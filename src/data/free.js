Gitterman Gallery presents an exhibition of contemporary work by Klea McKenna.

 This exhibition marks her first solo show in New York and the beginning of her representation by Gitterman Gallery. It is presented in association with Von Lintel Gallery in Los Angeles where McKenna will have a concurrent exhibition from September 7th through October 20th.

 The exhibition presents McKenna’s most recent work Generation alongside work from two of her previous series Automatic Earth and Web Studies. With each series, McKenna uses the photogram process innovatively to create unique gelatin silver prints that contain both vivid detail and ethereal abstraction. She pays homage to her subject’s histories while re-animating them through her engagement, revealing nuance, depth and energy.

 Unlike a photograph created with a camera, a photogram is a one-of-a-kind object that involves physical contact between a subject and the light sensitive printing surface, representing the mark of that interaction. McKenna emphasizes the physicality of this process and builds on it by forcing the paper to record texture as well as light. Working in near darkness she applies pressure on her subjects to physically imprint their texture into the photographic paper and then selectively exposes the paper to light creating what the artist calls “photographic reliefs.”

 With Generation, McKenna applies this method to textiles and women’s clothing that is rich in the legacy of touch: from the labor of their making, to the textures of the designs, to the marks of continual wear. She chooses objects from different cultures that have often gone through transformations from generation to generation. Her choices are guided by the histories of these textiles and the stories they reveal of migration, cultural appropriation, and women’s labor and sexuality. For McKenna, her process “is driven by my desire for haptic communication with women from a time and place different than my own…With each alteration, mending, and use, someone has inscribed themselves onto these textiles. Just as each garment was made through the patient labor of one woman’s body, so is it undone that way, worn-down slowly, deconstructed, or cannibalized to make something new.” With this in mind, the work fully embodies the dual meaning of its title, Generation, as both a reference to the passing of time and the creation of things.

 McKenna’s previous subjects – plants, rain, spider webs, wood and rock – reflect her ongoing dialogue with nature, which has always been an emotional force in her life. She is the daughter of renegade ethnobotanists, Kathleen Harrison and Terence McKenna, and was raised in the wilds of Hawaii and Northern California. Works from the Automatic Earth series are hand-embossed imprints of cross-sections of trees that are made in darkness then exposed to light. These “photographic rubbings” are more than just a record of a tree’s age; their luminosity reminds us that it was alive and it was a part of other’s lives. Web Studies are unique gelatin silver photograms of rain caught in the webs of orb-weaver spiders. Remarkable feats of engineering built each day to catch prey, the webs are also delicate and damaged and feel like artifacts of a magical realm. Like the patterns found inside trees and in our own lives, the webs follow a particular form yet each is unique and exquisitely flawed, marked by a specific series of complex interactions. Now a mother with a young daughter, McKenna is making work that references her daily life as a woman, artist and mother as well as her place in a continuum of generations.

 McKenna was born in Freestone, CA in 1980 and received a BA from the University of California in Santa Cruz and an MFA from the California College of the Arts. McKenna’s work has been exhibited over the past decade in numerous museums across the United States and is included in public collections including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Mead Art Museum at Amherst College, Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Santa Barbara Museum of Art and the United State Embassy Collection. McKenna lives and works in San Francisco.

Rachel Uffner Gallery presents an exhibition of new works by Sara Greenberger Rafferty. For her fifth solo show with the gallery, Rafferty has created a suite of works in kiln-formed glass - a new process and medium for the artist. Using a limited palette, Rafferty’s glass works function as image, screen, and material. They are transparent and translucent images formed and deformed by the kiln’s metamorphic heat and the intrinsic properties of glass.

<![CDATA[
For over forty years, David Ligare has been making paintings that conceptually link ancient Greek philosophy to contemporary social needs. Through established painting tropes like the figure and the landscape, Ligare has been embedding tenets of Plato and Aristotle within deftly painted scenes allegorizing social issues such as literacy and homelessness. With Still Life, the artist continues his thesis by giving new meaning and a new history to that eponymous genre. Hirschl &amp; Adler Modern is honored to present these 20 recent paintings by David Ligare, in his third solo exhibition with the gallery.

 David Ligare (born 1945, Oak Park, IL) studied at the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, CA. He has shown his paintings in many solo exhibitions in New York, Los Angeles, London, Rome, San Francisco, Seattle and elsewhere. His work can be found in numerous permanent collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco; the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, CT; the Frye Art Museum, Seattle; and the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, Italy. The artist’s recent retrospective, David Ligare: California Classicist, traveled from the Crocker Art Museum, Sacramento, CA to the Laguna Art Museum, Laguna, CA; Georgia Art Museum, Athens, GA; and Triton Museum of Art, Santa Clara, CA. This exhibition was accompanied by a major monograph on the artist. Ligare lives and works in the Carmel Valley, CA.

Gagosian presents I’ve Seen Gray Whales Go By, new paintings by Mary Weatherford. This is her first solo exhibition with the gallery.

 Weatherford makes large paintings comprising grounds of spontaneously sponged paint on heavy linen canvases surmounted by one or more carefully shaped and placed colored neon tubes. The canvas—prepared with white gesso mixed with marble dust, and worked on with Flashe paint, a highly pigmented but readily diluted emulsion—supports startlingly diverse applications of color. The surface of the paint ranges from matte and velvety to transparent and translucent. The canvas is at times densely filled, reading as a painterly continuum; at others, it shifts in color from edge to edge of the painting; and at yet others it contains clusters of marks set in relatively bare surroundings. And the color itself varies significantly: blurred blues, muted yellows, and carnival reds; mineral hues, evoking slate or steel; pinks suggestive of fruit or flesh; and many different blacks, recalling shiny feathers.

 The neon tubes attached to these fields of color advance a unique practice that Weatherford began in 2012, inspired by illuminated signs along the streets of old Bakersfield, California. In her use of neon, she transformed what had previously been used for advertising—and had been appropriated as such by earlier artists—into a radically new form of pictorial drawing. Casting an industrial light onto the fields of color, the neon tubes read as hand-drawn lines across the surface, although they are sometimes so bright that they are blinding to look at, creating afterimages. Weatherford has used one or as many as five individual tubes, often bent away from the surface, and on occasion extending beyond the edges of the canvas. The cords for the neon fixtures make their own layer of drawing on top of the painting, and lead down to large magnetic transformers sitting like anchors on the floor.

This exhibition will present new and recent work by Wolfgang Tillmans, marking the artist’s third solo show with David Zwirner. It follows his exhibition at the gallery’s Hong Kong location earlier this year, and his 2015 show, PCR, in New York.

 Few artists have shaped the scope of contemporary art and influenced a younger generation more than Tillmans. Since the early 1990s, his works have epitomized a new kind of subjectivity in photography, pairing intimacy and playfulness with social critique and the persistent questioning of existing values and hierarchies. Through his seamless integration of genres, subjects, techniques, and exhibition strategies, he has expanded conventional ways of approaching the medium and his practice continues to address the fundamental question of what it means to create pictures in an increasingly image-saturated world.

Mural Studies brings together eight of Lee Krasner’s rarely exhibited small-scale, gouache-on-paper studies for an unrealized Works Progress Administration mural painting. Created in 1940 (the same year Krasner produced, in her own words, her “first abstract work”) the gouaches investigate varying configurations of geometric and biomorphic forms alongside linear elements reminiscent of Jean Arp and Joan Miró. Dancing on flat backgrounds and reveling in vivid color, Krasner’s shapes consistently avoid the same designated window and door areas in each composition, suggesting that they were created with a single, now unknown, space in mind.

Andrew Edlin presents the first ever solo exhibition of paintings by Tom Bronk.

 Without studying color theory, Bronk (b. 1944, Stevens Point, Wisconsin) has invested over half a century investigating the optical properties of color, not following any rules so much as deranging them for maximum impact. Thankfully, his vigorous compositions do much to move the eye around or the vividness of his colors might just sear the retina.

Castelli Gallery presents Richard Pettibone: Recent Works. The exhibition features new paintings by the artist, which revisit subjects that have been pivotal to Pettibone’s work throughout his career. The largest series of paintings on view engage with Marcel Duchamp’s famous cover design for the 1936 issue of the avant-garde art magazine, Cahiers D’Art. The design consists of three concentric hearts in red and blue, which produce an optical illusion of depth and movement. Owing to this illusion, Duchamp called the image Coeurs Volants, or Fluttering Hearts. Although Duchamp’s work has long been a source of inspiration for Richard Pettibone, this particular image took on an added personal meaning for him after he suffered a heart attack in 2016. In the charming title and image of Duchamp’s Fluttering Hearts, Pettibone found a compelling, if dichotomous, resonance with his own physical experience. The act of reproducing Duchamp’s design by hand not only served as a therapeutic process of sorts, but also provided a tangible means of connecting the seemingly contradictory realities of Duchamp’s playful image and the gravity of Pettibone’s own condition.

 Other works in the exhibition include paintings of a Shaker chair in the artist’s signature photorealist style. Pettibone first became fascinated by Shaker furniture in the late 1980s when he moved to upstate New York and found himself living near the Shaker Museum in Mount Lebanon. This exposure gained him a deep appreciation for Shaker artisans’ dedication to craftsmanship, a quality that likewise characterizes Pettibone’s own work. The specific inspiration for this series of paintings is a Shaker chair, which the artist bought in 1990. At the time, the chair cost him $2,500. He recently discovered, however, that the same type of chair now sells at auction for only $400. Seen in the light of shifting popular tastes and market values, the chair became a renewed source of interest for Pettibone. Placing the piece of furniture outside on the deck of his house, he painted it as it appeared in the natural sunlight. In these images, the chair is represented independent of such arbitrary signs of worth as price and taste; its significance is seemingly no more nor less than the light it displaces, measurable by the shadow it casts.

 A third series of paintings in the exhibition responds to a market trend in the opposite direction. In 1965, Richard Pettibone created his first appropriation of Marcel Duchamp’s Bicycle Wheel, with the financial help of a friend who worked at the local post office. The appropriation was displayed later that year at the prominent Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles. As a token of his gratitude, the artist eventually gave the work to his friend as a gift. Over fifty years later, on March 10, 2017, Pettibone’s Bicycle Wheel sold at auction for £62,500. As in the case of the Shaker chair, this fluctuation in the artwork’s worth prompted the artist to revisit his original appropriation by creating a series of paintings honoring this new layer of significance. In reference to the auction that catalyzed this change, Pettibone’s new series of paintings, titled My First Duchamp Bicycle Wheel, 1965, represents not the sculpture itself, but of the image of the sculpture in the auction catalogue.

 While the three series of paintings included in the exhibition are in many ways quintessential examples of Pettibone’s work—revisiting some of the artist’s most important inspirations and showcasing his characteristic style—they also present something new in the strong autobiographical through-line that unites them. In this way, the show as a whole expresses one of the major themes conveyed by each series individually: the idea that although the object itself may remain the same, its value—whether emotional, conceptual, or financial—evolves over time.

In frNMEz, Los Angeles-based artist Matthew Monahan presents a new group of freestanding sculptures and paintings on aluminum. Known for his mastery of both traditional and industrial materials, Monahan’s new works reflect the physical and mental tug of war with the history of figuration. For this show Monahan pushes beyond the individual icon, populating his works with unruly masses and subjecting his figures to an intractable struggle. Rendered primarily in black and white, the viewer is forced to zoom in and out across a pixelated optical field, where sculpture and painting overlap and crossfade.

 Monahan carves his forms from standardized rectangular blocks, then slashes them into fragments, with torsos, limbs, and skulls repositioned to reanimate the whole. The bodies, caught in states of conflict and embrace, recall classical motifs of stone statuary. While quoting from the formal language of classical sculpture, Monahan inserts an element of sci-fi mystery, untethering his objects from their exact moment in time. Like relics found in a possible future, the sculptures are enclosed within perforated aluminum chambers that eschew the traditional relationship between the sculpture and its pedestal. The quality of the aluminum structures suggests the utilitarian blankness of server farm shelving, and the dissonance between these enclosures and the forms housed within flatten the view of the object, and at times cause the forms to disperse and disappear entirely. The black screens encrypt the figure-ground relationship and undercut their sculptural qualities in favor of a virtualized, private space.

 Monahan’s paintings echo this visual ambiguity and physical tension. Constructed from sheets of glossy white painted aluminum, the artist inscribes, collages, etches and sprays the surface with layers of grayscale to create chaotic multi-figure compositions. Stripped of any context provided by facial expressions or landscape, we are left to wonder whether the frenetic energy is one of celebration or outrage.

The Clock Unlocked is the first exhibition to encompass works from over four decades of New York painter Ellen Berkenblit’s practice. Hung salon style, arranged instinctually and without chronology, this unbound diary of paintings and drawings reveals the artist’s idiosyncratic ‘alphabet’— the core of her visual language.

 Images appear and re-submerge: a witch, a tiger, a shoe, a truck, all reveal themselves as a collection of curves, strokes, and slashes. One recognizes a gesture, and in it a notion of how the physical sensations and muscular reactions of the arm, the hand and the wrist all drive Berkenblit’s mark-making. The viewer becomes privy to an intimate calligraphy that is the result of the dance between artist, material, and surface.

 Spanning an entire wall is Sunshine, the artist’s largest canvas to date. Measuring over 16 feet in length, the composition features a leopard prowling alongside a traffic-jammed street. In its surfaces, worked and reworked, we see a collection of rhythms sketched out in a familiar hand. Loop-de-loops of exhaust fumes mimic the cursive ‘e-l-l-e’ in the artist’s name while dashed lines become lane markers. As we trace Berkenblit’s line, we are given a look into her memory; remembering, remembering again, and in the final composition, a perfect sense of order is restored and preserved.

 The Clock Unlocked is presented in conjunction with Ellen Berkenblit’s new monograph, Lines. The gallery will host a book signing and panel discussion featuring contributing writers Linda Yablonsky and Miciah Hussey on Thursday, September 20th.

CURATED BY: JENNY GEROW

 Brooklyn-based artist Mary Mattingly creates photographs, sculpture, and large-scale public art projects addressing climate change by drawing connections between the social and economic forces that make up the current political ecology impacting our environment. Mattingly works with a communal approach, a compelling model to urge viewers to rethink our relationship to the environment and to each other. The centerpiece of this exhibition, a deconstructed and creatively transformed 19,000-pound light medium tactical vehicle (LMTV, a military cargo truck), acts to provoke a reimagining of public life, centering on the existence of objects with violent histories. The LMTV is meant to be understood as a component reflecting a little visible but ever expanding global market for minerals and their complex supply chains (military and otherwise). Through this object, the artist poses a big question: What happens when an object that embodies both the systemic violence represented by war and and by climate change is manifested in a public space? The vehicle - used in the Gulf and Afghan wars and made in the U.S. by Oshkosh Defense - was collaboratively re-designed by nine artists and activists into a platform for performance. Throughout the run of the exhibition, programming by these artists and across BRIC will be presented on the platform. The activation of an object with such a loaded history will further challenge our ability to collectively reenvision our environment in the present and future. When we’re able to change the form and function of an object with a violent and complex history, it can be powerful. Can it become ritual? Can it be healing?

 Mary Mattingly is a Brooklyn-based visual artist best known for Swale, a floating food forest for New York. Mattingly’s work has been exhibited at the International Center of Photography, the Brooklyn Museum, the Palais de Tokyo, and in the Havana Biennial, among many other institiutions. With the U.S. Department of State and Bronx Museum of the Arts she participated in the smARTpower project, traveling to Manila. In 2009 Mattingly founded the Waterpod Project, a barge-based public space and self-sufficient habitat that hosted over 200,000 visitors in New York. Mattingly has been awarded grants and fellowships from the Yale University School of Art, the Harpo Foundation, NYFA, the Jerome Foundation, and the Art Matters Foundation. Her work has been featured in Aperture magazine, Art in America, Artforum, Sculpture, The New York Times, New York, The New Yorker, The Wall Street Journal, Brooklyn Rail, and the Village Voice; and on BBC News, MSNBC, Fox News, NPR, WNBC, NY1, and on Art21’s New York Close Up series.

CURATED BY: Jenny Gerow

 Memelismos is a collaborative, community-specific project by artist Juanli Carrión that uses sculpture to address popular memory and personal meanings embedded in everyday objects. For this iteration, the public in two different locations, Brooklyn and Mallorca, were invited to donate an object that represented a border they had crossed (geographic, political, emotional, social, etc). These two different islands, one a metaphorical island/sanctuary in the US, and Mallorca, one a Spanish island in the middle of the Mediterranean where thousands of immigrants loose their lives in boats trying to cross the border between Africa and Europe. The artist will take these 26 objects collected and wrap them in plastic of different colors, transforming them into abstract sculptures and disconnecting them from specific memories. The contributors of the objects will then arrange the sculptures in the Project Room, re-encountering their memories, physically present but visually abstracted. The installation becomes a collective, community activity that inspires interaction and conversation around memory and what happens when we cross borders.

 Juanli Carrión is a multi-media artist whose work explores community, memory, and collective and individual identity through site-specific installations. His work has been featured at White Box and Y Gallery, both in NY; Museo de Arte Contemporáneo, Lima, Peru; La Conservera, Murcia, Spain; Rosa Santos Gallery, Valencia, Spain; and Rum46, Arthus, Denmark. His public gardens have been installed in Brooklyn; Manhattan; the Bronx; Holma, Sweden; and Valencia and Murcia, Spain. Carrión is the recipient of numerous grants including from the Brooklyn Arts Council, Partnerships for Parks, and the Ministry of Culture of Spain. He received his BA in New Media Arts from Universite Vicennes-Saint Denis, Paris, and his BFA in Fine Arts from Universidad de Granada, Spain. He is currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Sculpture at the Universitat Politècnica de Valencia, Spain.

In response to the endemic murder of African-American men at the hands of authorities, Jon Henry’s photographs turn to the mothers of the communities, to the women who must endure the senseless loss and carry on. His ongoing project, Stranger Fruit, examines the mother-son relationship as a manifestation of the lasting effects of the fear of losing one’s loved ones. Henry photographs mothers alone and holding their son(s) in the classic pietà pose—that of the grieving Virgin Mary cradling the dead Christ—to explore the love, tenderness, and resilience of African-American families in the face of violence and heartbreak. Although the photographs do not document real incidents they evoke the ever-present possibility of loss to police violence. The photographs are shot where the family lives and works, with mothers holding both their young and grown sons, showing the universality of the fear that the women hold: the fear never leaves them and the violence occurs everywhere.

 Jon Henry was selected as the 2017 “Best in Show” winner of BRIC’s OPEN (C)ALL: TRUTH exhibition.

 Jon Henry has had solo exhibitions at NURTUREart, Brooklyn, and ShopKeepers Gallery, Washington, DC. His work has been exhibited at BRIC, Red Hook Labs, Ron Taylor Gallery, and Smack Mellon, all Brooklyn; the Rubber Factory, Aperture Foundation, and Mi-5 Gallery, all NY; Waller Gallery, Baltimore, MD; and at Spectrum Art, Miami, FL. Henry was also selected by Smack Mellon for “Hot Picks” 2017. He attended CUNY Queens College and New York Film Academy Photography Program.

<![CDATA[
Nahmad Contemporary presents its forthcoming exhibition (UN)COVERED: Miró | Hammons. The first to present the works of Catalan master Joan Miró (1893–1983) alongside postmodern American artist David Hammons (b. 1943), the exhibition illuminates the parallel iconoclastic practices of these two seemingly divergent artists whose careers only briefly overlapped. (UN)COVERED: Miró | Hammons highlights the analogous artistic strategies used to subvert traditional aesthetics in Miró’s visceral Sobreteixims (1972-73) and Hammons’ tarp-cloaked canvases (2000s–present). Whether “uncovering” alternative materials or “covering” conventional aesthetics, the works illustrate each artist’s unique formal innovations and conceptual undertakings.

 Notably, the exhibition will be the first to present Miro’s Sobreteixims in the United States since Pierre Matisse Gallery’s presentation in 1973 and will feature esteemed works on loan from the Fundació Joan Miró, Barcelona. A fully illustrated catalogue with scholarly texts by Jordana Moore Saggese and Linda Weintraub will accompany the show.

 Joan Miró’s pursuit of artistic liberty was fueled by the major historical events of his time, from World War I and II to the Spanish Civil War and Franco’s regime. As early as 1927, the artist famously declared an “assassination of painting,” and he committed himself thereon to unrestricted expression. He protested aesthetic norms and rejected technical mastery by rendering disorderly compositions and grotesque figuration, and utilizing unconventional media and supports, such as tar and rope or Masonite and Celotex. In 1970, when Miró began using ready-made materials to create his Sobreteixims, an old Catalan word for a small piece of fabric used as a patch for larger fabrics, he was 77 years old and lived on the island of Mallorca in permanent exile from the Franco regime. Harnessing the automatism of surrealism, he transformed the fibers of found supports—from traditional woven textile to industrial burlap sacks—through systematic destruction and alteration: puncturing and patching, tearing and stabilizing, and burning and extinguishing. The artist applied a range of media and objects to the transformed surfaces, such as acrylic, felt and string in Sobreteixim-sack 12 (1973) and buckets in Sobreteixim 14 (1973). Undulating between the treatment of support and ground, Miró emphasized the “un-covered” background material as much as the foreground. He confounded the customary figure-ground relationship by equating two traditionally hierarchical constituents of painting. Furthermore, Miro democratized his method of construction to defy the canon’s notion of the individual “artist genius”. Precociously postmodern, his Sobreteixims signify the process of their creation through incorporation of the objects used to produce them: brooms, buckets, or skeins of string.

 A figurehead in postwar art, Miró established many of the formal innovations of modernist painting and presaged the tenets of postmodernism during the last decade of his career. His spontaneous gestures established the principles of abstract expressionism, a movement that by the time David Hammons began his career had already been recognized as the new standard. It was this newfound canon that Hammons’ work defied as he commenced his career in 1960s America, a period marked by the civil rights movement and parallel sociopolitical upheavals. With particular critique of the art world and its history of racial exclusiveness, Hammons used nontraditional media, from chicken bones to sweatshirt hoods, and charged subject matter, such as slavery and racial slurs, to subvert the institutions perpetuating societal inequalities.

 Similar to Miró, Hammons asserted his general disdain for art, proclaiming in a 1989 interview, “I can’t stand art actually. I’ve never, ever liked art, ever.” Palpably rejecting the canon of postwar painting, his ongoing Tarp series, created in his Harlem, NY studio, consist of painted canvases shrouded with frayed and tattered industrial fabrics that he found in the streets. Only through the tears and holes of these dilapidated materials, such as in Untitled (2015), or through the rumpled meshed cloth, seen in Untitled (from Dirty Money series) (2014), does Hammons allow glimpses of painterly brush strokes underneath. He defies the hierarchical preciousness of the medium, covering that which is traditionally exposed and elevating as the focus that which is discarded. Similar to Miró upending the principals of painting, Hammons quite literally denies the canon its traditional viewership.

 Multidimensional in form and connotation, Miro’s Sobreteixims and Hammons’ Tarp paintings originate from distinct historical perspectives. Yet, when presented together, striking analogies are evidenced. Through parallel strategies of “uncovering” or “covering” institutional norms with ready-made fabrics, both series merge the material forays of found art with the critical commentary of conceptualism.

 Joan Miró (b. 1893, Barcelona; d.1983, Palma de Mallorca, Spain) studied at Lonja School of Fine Arts in Barcelona. He received encouragement early in his career from art dealer José Dalmau, who presented the artist’s first solo exhibition at his Barcelona gallery in 1918. Miró made his first trip to Paris in the 1920s, where he met Pablo Picasso; associated with the poets Max Jacob, Pierre Reverdy, and Tristan Tzara; and participated in Dada activities. His work was included in the Salon d’Automne of 1923, as well as in the first Surrealist exhibition at the Galerie Pierre in 1925.

 Miro is considered one of the seminal artists of the twentieth century. He worked across a breadth of media, including painting, drawing, sculpture, collage, and tapestry, to forge a remarkably original style that challenged the constraints of traditional aesthetics. Miró’s work can be found in prominent collections worldwide (e.g., Museum of Modern Art, New York, Tate Britain, London, and Reina Sofia, Madrid) and has been the subject of numerous international museum retrospectives, including at the Museum of Modern Art, New York (1941), Musée National d’Art Moderne, Paris (1962, 1978), and the Grand Palais, Paris (1974).

 David Hammons (b. 1943, Springfield, Illinois; lives in New York) moved to Los Angeles in 1963 and attended the Chouinard Art Institute and Otis Art Institute. In 1974, he moved to New York City, where he gained notoriety during the 1970s and 1980s for his work. Hammons’s oeuvre shares the material concerns of Arte Povera and harnesses the conceptual nuances of Duchamp. Although his career is over 30 years in the making, his use of a wide range of media and styles defies categorization. Notably, much of his work addresses cultural stereotypes and racial issues in the United States.

 Hammons received the MacArthur Fellowship in 1991. His work is collected by major public and private institutions internationally, including: Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo; Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge; Glenstone, Potomac; Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Museum of Modern Art, New York; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst, Gent; Fondation Cartier pour l’art contemporain, Paris; Francois Pinault Foundation, Venice; and Tate Britain, London.

<![CDATA[
Wanderer is a show of new and vintage work by photographer and filmmaker Danny Lyon. This will be Lyon’s first major exhibition since his 2016 Whitney retrospective. An artist whose work is always anchored in place, Wanderer features Lyon’s prints, montages and films from the American West – especially the town of Bernalillo, where he lives, and the Mexican- American border.

 In 1970, Lyon, a New Yorker native, moved to the small village of Llanito, New Mexico, in the Rio Grande Valley, north of Albuquerque. There he began making photographs and films of his neighbors, their children, and the local labor force, all undocumented workers from Mexico.

 One of these was Eddie, a Mexican national and undocumented worker, whom Lyon met when Eddie was fleeing from Immigration, which Mexican workers called “La Migra”. Lyon and Eddie worked together to build an adobe home, and Lyon became Eddie’s coyote, each year smuggling him back into the United States. In return, Eddie agreed to be filmed for Lyon’s 1971 film EL MOJADO, on view here. The title translates literally to “The Wet One” but Americans used it as “wetback” – a slur, then in common usage, that references the river many Mexican migrants wade through to reach the States. In the film, the Border Patrol discuss the pleasure they take in tracking and capturing Mexicans: “This is the most interesting part of the job. We really like this, you know, because it’s just like a hunter, you know, only you’re stalking a human being – and that really makes it a lot more fun.” Previously believed lost, El Mojado has been digitally remastered from the only known surviving print.

 In 1978, Danny Lyon and his wife Nancy visited Maricopa County, Arizona. At the time Maricopa was made up of huge citrus groves and a few retirement centers. With the help of the United Farm Workers labor union, who were then working to organize the area’s workers, Lyon met the Garays: a family from Queretaro, near Mexico City, that, each year, illegally crossed the border to work at the citrus farms. The Garays are the central figures in El OTRO LADO (The Other Side). In the film the workers sing as they work, “Our problem could easily be solved/give each of us a Gringita, then we can immigrate. As soon as we have our green card, we can be divorced.”

 Wanderer (2017), shown here for the first time anywhere, is the centerpiece of the exhibition. A forty-eight minute film, Lyon made the work alone, using a digital video camera that weighed less than a pound. Wanderer revisits many of the subjects depicted in the photographs on display in the show– especially members the Jaramillo family. In 1992, five years after Danny and Nancy finished the film that bears his name, Willie Jaramillo died in the Sandoval County jail in Bernalillo. Among the subjects in Wanderer are Willie’s younger brother Ferney, Ferney’s friend Dennis Baca, his sister Gloria, and his niece Janice, all of whom speak with great openness and emotion to Lyon.

 Wanderer is the name of Lyon’s new film, and the name of the show. It is the work of an artist that has the unique ability to use photography, prints, film and writing to record and create an America that he loves – a world that is at once beautiful, emotionally powerful, and threatened.

<![CDATA[
An exhibition of photographs by Jungjin Lee, known for her captivating primal landscapes, will be on view at Howard Greenberg Gallery from September 12 through November 10, 2018. The exhibition, which marks Lee’s second solo show with the gallery, is entitled Opening. A book of the same name with work from 2013 to 2016 was published by Nazraeli Press last year.

 Traveling to Arizona, New Mexico, and Canada, Lee captured abstract expanses of desert and mountain. Robert Frank has described her images as “landscapes without the human beast.” Harnessing the power of visual silence, her photographs inspire a sense of the deep and quiet interaction between the beholder and the elements of the earth.

 With a profound understanding of texture and craftsmanship, Lee’s large format photographs, printed on Korean mulberry paper, present a weight and physical presence that is both mysterious and deliberate. Many of the images in Opening are narrow verticals, reminiscent of the shape of hanging scrolls, which hint at Eastern philosophies and the pursuit of inner peace.

 “I don’t portray landscapes or nature,” says Lee. “The desert makes me see my inner self clearly and my aim is to make images of what I feel there—my inner state of mind, the eternal sense of being open and present.”

 Jungjin Lee (b. 1961) has exhibited her work widely in the United States, Europe, and Korea. Born in Korea, Lee began photographing in the early 1980s while studying ceramics at Hongik University in Seoul. She later earned an M.F.A. in Photography from New York University, and was an assistant to Robert Frank. She has published ten monographs including Unnamed Road (2015), Wind (2009), Jungjin Lee (2006), Thing (2005), Desert (2002), On Road/Ocean (2001), Jungjin Lee: Beyond Photography (2000), Wasteland (1997), and Lonely Cabin in a Far Away Island (1988). Her photographs are included in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Houston Museum of Fine Art; the Sonje Museum of Contemporary Art, Kyongju, Korea, and other prestigious institutions worldwide. In 2016, she was honored with an early career retrospective by the Fotomuseum Winterthur in Zurich. Also in 2016, her work was included in the exhibition This Place at the Brooklyn Museum which presented the work of 12 well-known photographers who traveled to Israel and the West Bank. Currently, her photographs are included in New Territory: Landscape Photographs Today at the Denver Art Museum through September 16, 2018. Lee lives and works in New York City.

<![CDATA[
Aliens and poodles populate the neon landscape of Margot Bird’s first New York solo exhibition “Poodle Saga”, sometimes tied together by chunky gold chains, sometimes floating on animal pattern backgrounds. Bird presents a new planet, where the aliens have enticed, or perhaps entrapped, the poodles into a lively exchange. Bird does not impose a narrative on her characters: aliens ride poodles like circus showgirls and poodles sprout butterfly wings or long snake-like necks in the candy-colored fluorescent world. Bird’s narrative looseness is echoed in her execution— the paintings are rich with color and free-flowing brushstrokes. We are able to catch glimpses of how this other world might have emerged, but there are no specifics.

 In addition to paintings are ceramic sculptures of gilded poodles, both glamorous and kitsch, recalling both a grandmother’s prized porcelain collection and a pop diva’s wildly lavish jewels. Her treatment of aliens, a potentially terrifying subject when one considers the possibilities, turns to the accepted anthropomorphized version of “little green men,” often sporting bling of their own. This melding of worlds is intentional: Bird is drawn to the vivid impression these trappings create. Just as the poodles’ silly traditional haircut transforms them into a snobby “high class” animal from an ordinary dog, the gold chains and rings people wear transform them from ordinary people into larger-than-life personalities. Bird’s works embrace the ridiculous and indulge our desire to make the average spectacular and the unknown loveably familiar.

 Margot Bird (b. 1982, Sioux City, Iowa) lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. She received her Bachelor of Arts degree from University of Wisconsin- Madison, WI in 2006. She has exhibited at Yo Mama Gallery, Brooklyn, NY and created murals in Oaxaca, Mexico City, Seattle and New York City. This will be Bird’s first exhibition with the gallery.

<![CDATA[
Continuing the work Dorian Gaudin produced for the exhibition Rites and Aftermath (Palais de Tokyo, 2017) the artist’s second solo exhibition at Nathalie Karg Gallery is comprised of, as a base structure, a long rolling conveyer belt. Its chains maintain fragments of architectural elements and floating mundane objects such as a coffee cup. The monotone repetition of the movement created by the conveyor belt recalls the pace and the landscape of animation or video games. As an extension of the conveyor, several geometric and orthogonal motifs evoking a Tetris composition are slotted together and suggest the shapes of a table, a chair or stairs. The objects are exposed on thin metal structures with fringed ends, and seem to peel off from their construction, as if they were undressing and exchanging skins, depriving themselves of sculptural depth and allowing only the surface to emerge. The technique developed by the artist to produce the sculptures inverts the usual steps of printing: first the pattern is created, then the background to which the fiberglass support is apposed. The pieces are therefore ripped off their mold, revealing their final texture, and the motif on every sculpture seems to remain the same, yet is altered by the shape of the object itself. A series of wall works using this procedure extends from the installation into the gallery space.

 In his theory “Object-Oriented Ontology,” American philosopher Graham Harman states that “the world is clearly not the one as manifest to humans,” suggesting that objects have the same autonomy as do humans. Dorian Gaudin, influenced by mechanical and kinetic art, engineers in his practice series of sculptures and installations that defy gravity and dimensions, punctuated by motors and tensions. Machine rituals and optical illusions are points of departure for his production, and the artist pays a particular attention to movement and the choreography of objects, composing a Ballet Mécanique* of aluminum, chrome and fiberglass.

 -Martha Kirszenbaum

 *Ballet Mécanique (1923-24) is a Dadaist film conceived, written, and co-directed by the artist Fernand Léger

 Dorian Gaudin (b. 1986 in Paris, France) is a New York-based artist who works in sculpture and installation. He studied at the École Nationale supérieure des Arts Décoratifs, Paris (2009), the École Nationale supérieure des Beaux Arts, Paris (2011) and Le Fresnoy, Tourcoing, France (2011). His installations often include masterfully engineered machines that lack any explicit purpose, yet move spontaneously, animated from within. These autonomous and unpredictable works of art allow us to question the nature of objects and whether we can engage with machines as active users or are in factpassive viewers. Gaudin’s work has been shown at galleries and institutions nationally and internationally, including Palais de Tokyo, Paris. His work will be included in the Guangzhou Triennial (2018) and the Greater Taipei Biennial of Contemporary Art (2018).

Stefano Rogino
 Neorealism is difficult to define.
 It is an impulse. It is a moment. It is an act of recovery and restoration.
 It is a source of inspiration, a fountain that never stops flowing.
 ––Martin Scorsese

 An exhibition of Italian postwar photography will be on view at Howard Greenberg Gallery from September 12 through November 10, 2018. Through the lens of neorealism, The New Beginning for Italian Photography: 1945-1965 explores how photographers documented daily realities during the two decades after World War II. The exhibition at Howard Greenberg is in conjunction with NeoRealismo: The New Image in Italy, 1932–1960, which opens in September in two exhibitions at New York University. Also in September, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is featuring a selection of postwar images from their permanent collection. In addition, a new book, NeoRealismo: The New Image in Italy 1932-1960 (Prestel) by Enrica Viganò, with a foreword by Martin Scorsese will be published in September.

 Associated with cinematic and literary depictions of postwar conditions, photography’s embrace of neorealism illuminated the here and now of a country emerging from ruins, alive with vitality and hope. With print media outlets on the rise, photographers and their reportage played an integral role in picturing the postwar period when 1945, later termed “year zero,” was time for a new beginning. In graphic compositions that master line and shape, the images on view capture fleeting moments that become the seeds of longer imagined narratives. Humanist in nature, the beautifully printed images in the exhibition convey a concern with finding unusual stories in quotidian scenes.

 Among the photographers in the exhibition are Carlo Bavagnoli, who photographed in working-class neighborhoods in Rome, and later contributed to Life magazine; Mario de Biasi, who began taking pictures in 1944 with a camera found in the rubble of Nuremberg; Sante Vittorio Malli, who dedicated himself to portraits and landscapes, and established the photo group, Il Naviglio, in 1956; Franco Pinna, who took his first photographs in Rome in 1944, during the arrival of the Allied troops; and Stefano Robino, an artist and designer known for his cultured and elegant style.

 Independent curator and journalist Enrica Viganò has spent over a decade researching the phenomenon of Italian neorealism in photography and identifying important works and artists of the period. As she writes in an essay in the new book NeoRealismo: The New Image in Italy 1932-1960, “This period of the country’s rebirth was characterized by an attempt at collective identification, a venture in which photography could play an essential role. The vision of the photographers dealt with genuine people, real landscapes, collective stories that vibrated with skin and soul.”

<![CDATA[
Bookstein Projects presents an exhibition of recent paintings by Elena Sisto. This is the artist’s third solo-show with Lori Bookstein and her first with Bookstein Projects.

 Painted over the last two years, the paintings in this exhibition feature a cast of cartoon-like characters that function as self-portraits of the artist herself. Devoid of naturalistic colors, the faces of the subject are painted in a highly-keyed palette that includes coral, jade green, indigo and even violet. These faces appear at once both earnest and other-worldly as they poke through billowing, cloud-like masses of silver hair. In some instances, such as in Spirited Away, the hair envelops the entirety of the composition, isolating the figure’s green face from any discernible sense of place. Indeed, the artist’s hair becomes the focal point of a number of these paintings and acts as a signifier of both sex and age, as well as the self-assuredness that comes with both.

 The titles of a majority of the paintings take their names from popular culture. Vagabond (for Agnès Varda) is an homage to the famous French director’s 1985 drama by the same name. Rapunella is a portmanteau of Rapunzel and Cinderella, the popular children’s fairytales. Taken as a whole, the titles suggest a land of alternate reality, or one so removed as to forgo any direct reference to the observed world. Flowers are articulated in fabric-like pattern of polka dots. The sky, when visible, is striated in bands of unblended, albeit prismatic color – sherbet orange, turquoise blue and a deep cobalt. Even buildings, stripped down to their most basic rectangular forms, seem like metonymy for New York City. These are paintings that elicit connotations of place and age and yet they resist any clear categorization.

 Elena Sisto (b. 1952) splits her time between New York, NY and Rhinebeck, NY. She received her BA in Art and Rhode Island School of Design and studied at the New York Studio School. The artist has been included in numerous museum exhibitions including those at the Wexner Center for the Arts, Katonah Museum of Art, Miami Dade Museum of Art + Design and the University of Florida, Gainesville. In addition, she was included in the 43rd Biennial of Contemporary American Painting at The Corcoran Gallery, Washington, DC. She is the recipient of numerous awards and fellowships including the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship, the Inglis Griswold Nelson Prize from the National Academy Museum and School, and the National Endowment for the Arts Visual Artist’s Fellowship. She was inducted into the National Academy Museum in 2015.

<![CDATA[
Nailya Alexander Gallery presents George Tice’s third solo exhibition. Our exhibition commemorates the artist’s life and his six decades of contributions to the fields of fine art photography, printmaking, and American history.

 Born on October 13, 1938 in Newark, New Jersey, George Tice was inspired as a young boy by his father’s photo albums to purchase a $29.95 Kodak Pony camera and begin taking photographs. At age fourteen, he became the youngest member of the Carteret Camera Club, and a few years later enlisted in the U.S. Navy as a photographer’s mate. In 1959, the twenty-year-old Tice photographed an explosion aboard the USS Wasp. The photograph made the front page of The New York Times and caught the attention of Edward Steichen, then Director of the Department of Photography at the Museum of Modern Art, who acquired the photograph for the museum’s collection.

 Tice, whose eye has been drawn to factory facades, junked cars, and eerily lit gas stations, has long explored his affinity for the mid-century generation of American social and landscape photographers that includes such luminaries as Walker Evans. Tice’s photographs, however, carve out their own space in photographic history as methodical and deeply felt meditations on place and memory, particularly with respect to the unpolished and oft-forgotten pockets of small-town America. In a 2000 review for The New York Times, critic Margarett Loke wrote, “For Mr. Tice, time has a way of standing still. He finds quiet, enduring beauty in such places as the interior of a Shaker building in Maine; in a ghostly ribbon of a road in Lancaster, PA, and in a tree trunk in Paterson that bears the hieroglyphics of time.”

 In his photographs of Paterson, New Jersey, Tice collects palpable evidence of America’s crumbling industrial past with artistry and grace. Once a 19th-century manufacturing hub, Paterson is now a city of classic American diners, empty mills, and outlet stores. Part artist, part historian, Tice collects and commemorates the city’s history with each photograph, and in the process assembles a greater history of the country’s ever-changing social, economic, and architectural landscape. Reflecting upon Paterson in a 2002 interview with The New York Times, Tice observed, “A place belongs to those who claim it.”

 Each of these neglected locales is transformed by Tice’s lens and craft into a masterful print. Profoundly moved by a platinum print of Frederick Evans’s Lincoln Cathedral: From the Castle (1898), Tice has devoted himself equally to the taking of photographs and to the craft of printing and has acquired a reputation as one of the most skillful darkroom printers of his generation. The uniquely desolate and painterly light of a George Tice print produces a mood not dissimilar to that found in an Edward Hopper painting. Tice served as Edward Steichen’s last printer and was entrusted to create limited-edition portfolios of photographs by Frederick Evans, Francis Bruguière, and Edward Weston.

 George Tice’s photographs can be found in over 125 museum collections around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the J. Paul Getty Foundation. He has received numerous fellowships and commissions, including from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Foundation, as well as The Bradford Fellowship (U.K.).

“Before my eyes were both young bodies and old physiques, some starkly naked, others seductively sheathed. They presented the artifice of feigned desire in vintage photographs from one hundred and twenty-five years ago. Some displayed the fresh faces of innocence while others the weary lined facades of bitter experience. These images were compelling individually but as a whole, they captured an unseen world of negotiated passion in American life, written about extensively but rarely, for good reason, documented visually. Multiple feelings of curiosity and excitement came over me after finally realizing the potential importance of these photographs. There was also a recognition that their acquisition carried responsibility to find out the story, which lay hidden behind those faces and figures from another era.” -Robert Flynn Johnson

 “If a stranger arrived in almost any American city during the 1890s, he would have easily found a red-light district, tolerated by the police in exchange for graft, and accepted by the community because it hid and contained prostitution in a segregated neighborhood. The oldest profession was neither legal nor illegal; it was simply tolerated as a ‘Necessary Evil,’ as an effort to protect ‘innocent’ women and girls from rapacious men.

 That would soon change, but during much of the nineteenth century, Americans viewed prostitution as a safety valve for sexually active men who might attack respectable young women or for wandering husbands who strayed from their uninterested wives” –Ruth Rosen

 “Known as ‘unmentionables,’ undergarments were only seen in rare glimpses in daily life—a briefly lifted skirt of a woman crossing a muddy street exposed the lace ruffle of a petticoat. Worn by the prostitutes that William Goldman photographed, lingerie gives the erotic association with the nude body, but, with part of the picture unseen, the mind fills in using the power of the imagination. The undergarments would have provided the titillation of layers of fabric unraveling and protracted flirtation.” -Dennita Sewell

 “For these working girls who were already going against the drudgery of toiling in a factory or as a domestic, who were surviving in a patriarchal world by their wits and sexuality, the opportunity to sit for Mr. Goldman was very likely not only thrilling—it was also empowering” -Dita Von Teese

 “What we can surmise from his photographs is that Goldman was a truly sensitive human being both artistically and emotionally. The women seem playful in some images while moody and withdrawn in others, especially when they hide their identity with masks, fans, or hands. The manner in which Goldman posed these women, however, is never crude or unfeeling. He had a way of allowing the women to appear natural in the presence of his camera. The women display a willing collaboration with him in the creation of these captivating images.” -Robert Flynn Johnson

Half Gallery presents Flat Earth, Geneive Figgis’ second solo exhibition at the gallery. Figgis synthesizes historical paintings, interior distortions and mythological planes to highlight her unique tincture of romance and melancholy.

 In Neptune and Amphitrite, the artist takes David Teniers The Younger’s composition and transforms it into what could only be a Figgis design incorporating a bright color palette, swirled skies and watchful expressions. In Sisters, the artist leaves the viewer inside one of her dreamy residences, complete with vague familial portraits, an elaborate chandelier and two decorated women who no doubt have a secret between them.

 In Artforum, Riccardo Venturi writes of Figgis’ figures from her exhibition at Almine Rech in Paris:

 Genieve Figgis’ painted tableaux often seem to present a dramatic event, like an operatic performance, but one whose coordinates can’t fully be discerned. The Irish painter’s characters, who adopt theatrical poses or stand in groups, as in a conversation piece, are well aware that they are on public display.

 Genieve Figgis’ first solo exhibition at Half Gallery, Good Morning, Midnight was in 2014. Currently, Figgis is exhibiting work in L’Alamanch at Le Consortium in Dijon through October 14th, 2018.

This will be Max De Esteban’s, Barcelona-based artist’s 3rd solo exhibition at the gallery.

 With this series, Esteban continues his examination of our world as mediated by and through technology, through creating photographic imagery that utilizes the traditions of appropriation and remix. As with his earlier bodies of work, the artist dispenses with the linear perspective inherent in Western art, as a key device in his examination of how technology is a determining factor in artistic expression, in human relationships, and in our mediation of the world.

 “Binary Code, attempts to give visual expression to a world where databases and algorithms determine the ultimate reality, including nature. This is essentially the end of the order of nature as we know it”.—states Max de Esteban.

 The Binary Code series are a colorful concoction of collages that excite our imagination and send the viewer on a trajectory of multiple narratives. The exhibition features 9 artworks from a complete series numbering twenty-nine.

With the beginning of the Fall 2018 exhibition season, Pace Prints will be celebrating its 50th anniversary as a gallery and publisher of fine art prints and multiples.

 Since 1968, Pace Prints has embraced a philosophy of providing artists with printmaking facilities in a wide variety of media, from etching to handmade paper and beyond, to enable them to pursue their creativity as printmakers. During this period, Pace Prints has collaborated with over 150 artists internationally.

 To celebrate this 50th anniversary, Pace Prints will initiate the fall season with two exhibitions at 32 East 57th Street and 521 West 26th Street of editions that were created by artists who began their association with Pace Prints in the first decade of its publishing activities.
 At Pace Prints, 32 East 57th Street:

 Welcome Back is an exhibition of nine initial Pace Prints projects — including our inaugural publication, Lucas Samaras’s Book, 1968 — and editions by Gene Davis, Robert Goodnough, Charles Hinman, Nicholas Krushenick, Sven Lukin , Kenzo Okada, Ernest Trova, and Jack Youngerman. The exhibition will open on September 12th and continue through October 13th.

Tanya Leighton, Berlin and Bureau, New York presents a solo exhibition, WIWI FOOD by the Berlin-based artist, Jonas Lipps. The exhibition marks the second half of an exchange between the two galleries, which began with Julia Rommel’s current exhibition, Twin Bed, in Berlin.

 Lipps’s works often take up predominant systems of social order: schools, shopping centers, transportation networks, nation states and jails. These environments of control find themselves permeated by spoofs on their branding and design, malapropisms, anachronisms and associative inventions. Similarly, the pieces in Lipps’s latest body of work on view at Bureau are painted, drawn and collaged using both existing images and surreal interventions. Lipps repurposes paper napkins, the seals of correctional facilities and advertisements, placing them within environments that are charged with freudian spillages, libidinal utterances and personal preoccupations.

 Jonas Lipps was born in Freiburg/Breisgau, Germany. He now lives and works in Berlin. His work has been exhibited worldwide, with recent exhibitions including Tanya Leighton, Berlin; Gallery Celine, Glasgow; LISZT, Berlin; Paradise Garage, Los Angeles; Galerie der Stadt Schwaz; The Prague Biennial; and Kunstverein Bremerhaven.

<![CDATA[
Spencer Brownstone Gallery presents Flat End Dome, our first exhibition with artist Shane Darwent. Utilizing a wide range of materials and mediums Darwent unpacks the visual vernacular of American architecture and reassembles them into monuments of urban living.

 Darwent’s interests lie somewhere in between the city and the suburbs. Vinyl siding, fences with broken links, and gravel forms, familiar in any region, are featured in his work. His dismantling and collaging of veneers and faux-material exposes their mimicry and converts them into monuments to these memories.

 The three large-scale sculptures, Basalt, Ballast, and Bus Stop are composed of multiple store front awnings. These illuminated monoliths are instantly recognizable and yet easily overlooked by those traversing the city. The vivid colors and drum-tight vinyl that seem to herald prosperity often fade and loosen overtime. In Darwent’s work, these events offer opportunity to patch and transform, becoming painterly swatches of colors and shapes.

 Shane Darwent is a studio artist whose interdisciplinary practice fuses architecture, sculpture, painting and photography to explore the poetic potential of the ex urban built vernacular. Exhibiting internationally, Darwent has been an artist-in-residence at Ragdale, the Ucross Foundation and the Jentel Artist Residency Program, as well as a Core Fellow at Penland School of Crafts. Recently named an Outstanding Student in Contemporary Sculpture by International Sculpture Center, Shane has received numerous grants including an Individual Artist Fellowship from the Tennessee Arts Commission. He holds his MFA from the University of Michigan and a BFA from the Maryland Institute College of Art. Recent exhibition venues include the Art Gallery of Windsor, Wasserman Projects in Detroit, Belger Arts Center in Kansas City, the Spring Break Art Show in New York City, and Oklahoma Contemporary in Oklahoma City. Darwent is currently an artist-in-residence at the Tulsa Artist Fellowship in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Silas Von Morisse Gallery presents MONIKA WEISS KOIMAN II- Years Without Summers (24 Nocturnes), the first solo exhibition at the gallery of celebrated Polish artist MONIKA WEISS.

 Monika Weiss’ Koiman II – Years Without Summers (24 Nocturnes) is a single-channel, digital 4K film projection with sound, comprising 24 short films and sound compositions, and a series of related charcoal and graphite drawings. This work—inspired by Winterreise (Winter Journey), a cycle of 24 songs for voice and piano composed in 1828 by Franz Schubert— is dedicated to the artist’s late mother, pianist Gabriela Weiss, and to current refugees and migrants around the world.

 In 1815, the eruption of the Mt. Tambora volcano in Indonesia caused a globally migrating ash cloud, resulting in dramatic cooling in Europe and the northern United States. The unusually cold and dark summer of 1816, often referred to as the “year without summer” was characterized by persistent rain, snow and frost, which triggered agricultural disaster, famine and migration and potentially inspired a number of works by artists, composers and writers at the time, including Winterreise. The accounts by travellers at sea following the explosion describe dark days where it was impossible “to see your hand outstretched.” Weiss chose the musical and painterly form of the nocturne as a metaphor for the darkness of the year without summer and the current time in which our culture and civilization today truly cannot see its own future beyond “the hand outstretched.”

 “Two hundred years later, the world appears to me as if shrouded in a symbolic ash cloud resulting from global climate change, the current refugee crisis and the gradual global move towards fascist ideologies,” says the artist. “Koiman II is meant to evoke this notion of darkness, coldness and clouding, yet it also offers filmic and sonic poetry and beauty, as a form of hope and a place of refuge.”

 Koiman II presents Weiss’ vision of our current period of “dark summers” through her film, drawing and musical composition and performance. Her’ silent films depict gradually unfolding scenes shot from a stationary camera, suggesting a contemplative viewing akin to painting or drawing. Each of the 24 “still-films” shows an anonymous female protagonist (performed by the artist in wintery landscapes) wearing a veil and long black dress; the silent, slow gestures evoke a mournful lamentation. The scenes are choreographed, filmed and edited by the artist, who uses superimposition and reversed sequences to create a sense of suspended time, with no clear beginning or end. Weiss wrote vocal and instrumental music for each of the films and worked with opera vocalists to perform her compositions. She edited and recomposed the recordings into unique, polyphonic environments for each film. All of the drawings in the exhibition appear as superimposed images in the films while existing as individual, stand-alone works.

 “The whole of this work is dedicated to my late mother, pianist Gabriela Weiss who died in April 2017, and to all currently displaced refuges and migrants trying to find shelter. As a child I listened daily to my mother practicing Chopin’s Nocturnes. Forever scarred by World War II, my mother barely escaped a hunt systematically exercised by both Soviet and German occupants in Poland, surviving as a refugee in her mother’s arms.” (Monika Weiss)

 To date this project has received generous support from Harvestworks Digital Media Arts Center, New York City, BRIC Arts Media, Brooklyn, NY, and Yaddo Artists’ Colony, Saratoga Springs, NY.

<![CDATA[
For the past four decades British artist Nicola Hicks’ practice has centered around a world populated by a cast of humanized creatures and beastlike humans, expressing the universal, often darker aspects of humanity. The present exhibition brings together works from key periods in Hicks’ career from the 1990s to the present day, and will be the first exhibition of works created entirely in bronze.

 Hicks’ characters frequently resemble figures from common myths and shared stories, using a distinctive personal vocabulary to establish a connection between ancient and contemporary worlds. Central to this exhibition are works that involve themes of childhood and coming-of-age, often drawn from the perspective of the maternal gaze.

 In the work titled Recovered Memory, the two standing figures of a wolf-man looming over a tiny child, enact a sinister scenario reminiscent of Little Red Riding Hood. The wolf is a recurrent figure in Hicks’ work, often interpreted as engendering childhood fears.

 The newly-cast bronze sculpture Brave (loaned by the Yale Center for British Art), depicts the figure of a young boy, who adapts to the susceptibilities of youth by drawing his courage from the protective armour of a bearskin. Hicks continues to explore the fragile transition to adulthood in a work featuring a boyish figure with wolf’s head titled Show me a Man and I’ll Show you a Boy. The contrast between his proud, puffed out chest and diminutive frame reflects a jarring distinction between the innocence of the inner child and the culturally-driven pressures of ‘being a man’.

 Other hybrid characters continue the transition into manhood, such as the recent work Owl Boy, where the heavy eyelids on the owl-human form allude to a nocturnal existence, and the nerve-ridden, fractured feeling of adolescence. In Relic, the fragmented bull’s head and human torso represents a more ancient male character, who appears to be alone in the world and out of sync with contemporary times. Hicks describes the Minotaur’s otherness as relating to the ‘otherness of men’, suggesting that the Minotaur motif, in her vocabulary, might also at times relate to a female sexual power and energy.

 Originally created using a mixture of plaster and straw, the bronze casting process harnesses and preserves the haptic energy of their fragile surfaces, with patinas in earthern, black or white tones, recalling timeless natural substances derived from the earth, such as oil, clay, chalk or lime.

 Nicola Hicks was born in London in 1960 and studied at Chelsea School of Art and the Royal College of Art. In 1995 Hicks was awarded an MBE for her contribution to the visual arts. Hicks’ sculpture and drawings have been presented in numerous international museums and galleries and she has completed several public commissions including large scale sculptures at Schoenthal Monastery, Langenbruck, Switzerland. Recent solo exhibitions include Tayloe Piggott Gallery, Wyoming USA; Sorry, Sorry Sarajevo, St Paul’s Cathedral, London; Sculpture by Nicola Hicks at the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, United States; and her work was included in The Universal Addressability of Dumb Things, curated by Mark Leckey, as part of the Hayward Touring series at venues across the UK during 2013.

 A major new monograph was published by Elephant in association with Flowers Gallery in 2017. Nicola Hicks: Keep Dark (Elephant Publishing) brings together around 100 images of Hicks’s sculptures and drawings, from 1985 to the present day, with accompanying texts written by the acclaimed authors and leading cultural figures David Mamet, Candia McWilliam, Max Porter, Matilda Pye, Will Self and Patterson Sims.

David Nolan Gallery presents “The garden became my study,” an exhibition of work by Ian Hamilton Finlay (1925-2006).The exhibition brings together works associated with the artist’s most celebrated achievement - Little Sparta, a classical garden that he built on a farm in Stonypath near Edinburgh. Created over four decades, Little Sparta fuses many of Finlay’s artistic ideas, from the French revolution, to the classical world, and nature. The display will include works incorporating sculpture in bronze, wood, ceramic, and stone, as well as three text-based wall paintings. This is the artist’s ninth exhibition at the gallery, and has been organized in collaboration with Pia Simig and the Estate of Ian Hamilton Finlay.

<![CDATA[
Hauser &amp; Wirth is delighted to present ‘The Deserted City,’ an exhibition dedicated to the Italian post-war sculptor, painter, and poet Fausto Melotti. ‘The Deserted City’ is curated by Edoardo Gnemmi, Director Fondazione Fausto Melotti, and sheds new light on Melotti’s merging of sculptural mastery and poetic sensibility through a unique exhibition design that draws inspiration from the metaphysical landscapes of Giorgio de Chirico’s paintings and Alberto Burri’s magnum opus, ‘Grande Cretto.’ Through an atmosphere that hovers between the earthly and the otherworldly, ‘The Deserted City’ situates Melotti’s work within the context of his fellow Italian artistic titans and highlights their shared belief that art can facilitate what Gnemmi has called ‘a return to life.’

 Throughout the gallery, large plinths carve paths that recall the ‘cretto’ (crack) of Alberto Burri’s sprawling ‘Grande Cretto,’ an immense concrete landscape conceptualized by Burri in 1981 as a memorial to the Sicilian city of Gibellina, which was decimated by an earthquake in the late 1960s. As visitors move through winding pathways, the exhibition takes the form of an enigmatic theatrical space, enhancing the narrative powers of Melotti’s sculptures and igniting the viewer’s imagination. At the core of the installation is Melotti’s ‘I Sette Savi (The Seven Sages)’ (1960), which consists of seven towering mannequins in pure white plaster, frozen in a silent exchange. This sense of temporal suspension is reminiscent of the spectral figures and dreamscapes from paintings by de Chirico, who sought to ‘paint a reality that transcended the sensitive.’ Transfiguring the routine and the known into enigma, de Chirico’s work purposefully distorts otherwise familiar landscapes into dreamlike settings that the Italian writer Italo Calvino, a close friend of Melotti’s, described as ‘a city of the mind.’

 The landscape of ‘The Deserted City’ unfolds around these Seven Sages, and Melotti’s most iconic works from the 1940s through the mid-1980s – including his ceramics, fantastical Teatrini (Little Theaters), and lithe brass sculptures – are installed atop the large-scale plinths. His 1955 drawing ‘La città deserta (The deserted city),’ from which the exhibition takes its title, is a rare self-portrait of Melotti. It depicts the artist as a lone figure traversing a desolate, burned landscape, while ‘Il Canal Grande (The Grand Canal)’ (1963) recalls the distinctive architecture of Venice in painted terracotta and brass. ‘Le torri della città invisibile (The Towers of the invisible City)’ (1976 (1980)), a monumental construction delicately wrought in brass, was central to Italo Calvino’s description of his own ‘thin city’; Calvino believed Melotti’s sculptures were the epitome of what utopian metropolises should be: ‘cities on stilts, spider web cities.’ The sculpture is typical of many of Melotti’s later works from the 1970s and 1980s, which are characterized by similarly rhythmic geometric forms that express a resolved and distinctly humanist sensibility.

 ‘The Deserted City’ also includes more than forty of Melotti’s ceramics, which he created in response to the pain, trauma, and despair that crowded his thoughts in the aftermath of the Second World War. Aerial bombings destroyed the artist’s studio in Milan and profoundly altered his artistic vision, precipitating a literal and symbolic rupture in his idealized pursuit of abstraction. As a result, his attention shifted to the craft and production of ceramics and terracotta. Rendered in polychromatic glazes, these works illustrate the artist’s urgent and necessary return to figuration.

 Working on an intimate scale, Melotti also used clay and terracotta to create his diorama-style Teatrini, an important series of metaphysical worlds enclosed within rectangular structures and filled with fantastical groupings of objects and figures. Framing a single moment or multiple mises-en-scène, Melotti’s Teatrini offer lively spontaneous narratives, from small poetic gestures to absurdist allegorical possibilities. An early example from this body of work, ‘Teatrino (Little Theater)’ (ca. 1950), demonstrates his geometric schematization of the figure. Anchoring his post-war practice throughout the 1940s and 1950s, other Teatrini, like ‘Meditazione domestica (Domestic Meditation)’ (1959), express mystical, poetic tableaux that bring to mind the Surrealist-inspired boxed assemblages of American artist Joseph Cornell.

 A true polymath, Melotti was a passionate student of literature, philosophy, mathematics, and music. As viewers move in and around the sprawling installation of ‘The Deserted City,’ these varied intellectual pursuits manifest through narrative threads that converge and evolve, suggesting a complex landscape informed by the principles of harmony, order, geometry, and musical structure that Melotti cherished and cultivated over the course of his six-decade career.

 About the Artist

 Considered a pioneer of Italian art, Fausto Melotti is acknowledged for his unique contribution to the development of mid-century European Modernism. Coming of age in prewar Milan, and living through the horrors of the Second World War, Melotti trained as a figurative artist and studied under Italy’s leading Symbolist sculptor Adolfo Wildt at the Accademia di Brera in Milan. There he befriended fellow pupil Lucio Fontana in 1928, and in the following decade shifted his focus to abstraction and a new non-objective art. Melotti developed influential friendships with the Rationalist architects of Gruppo 7 and the abstract artists who gravitated around Galleria Il Milione. With Fontana, he joined the ‘Abstraction-Création’ movement, developing firm ideas about non-figurative art.

 Influenced by his education in engineering and music, Melotti’s first abstract sculptures were geometrical and echoed the young artist’s academic training in order, rhythm, proportions, and form. His later work of the 1970s and 1980s is characterized by rhythmic geometric forms with an underlying humanist narrative that curator Douglas Fogle describes as ‘quivering just on the threshold between the solidity of figuration and the immateriality of abstraction.’

 Melotti died in 1986, and was posthumously awarded the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale that year. His work has been exhibited at numerous institutions including the Museum Ostwall Dortmund, Germany, in 1971; Palazzo della Pilotta, Parma, Italy, 1976; Palazzo Reale, Milan, Italy, 1979; Forte Belvedere, Florence, Italy, 1981; Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Moderna, Rome, Italy, 1983; IVAM – Centre Julio González, Valencia, Spain, 1994 – 1995, and Aichi Prefectural Museum of Art, Nagoya, Japan, 1999. In 2010, Kunsthalle Mannheim, Germany presented a comprehensive survey of Melotti’s work, which subsequently toured to Kunstmuseum Winterthur, Switzerland. Melotti is represented in the collections of The Museum of Modern Art, New York NY, and Walker Art Center, Minneapolis MN.

Timothy Taylor, New York presents the complete collection of Philip Guston lithographs; 25 works created by the artist and published by Gemini G.E.L. in 1980, the year of his death.

 The lithographs represent the apotheosis of Guston’s visual language and read as a lexicon of the emblems that characterize his distinct iconography. Prior to the collaboration with Gemini, Guston had made very few prints in his life, generally preferring to draw. Yet in his last years, at ease with his established vocabulary, he decided to revisit the medium, perhaps recognizing a desire and the opportunity for wide dissemination. Guston had suffered a heart attack the previous year, which brought an increasing feeling of fragility and concern with mortality. In light of this existential moment, “the rapidity of the lithographic process enabled him to produce an abundance of new images without the physical effort needed to paint large-scale canvases”.

Peter Freeman, Inc. presents an exhibition of new sculpture by Thomas Schütte, among the most acclaimed artists of his generation. This is the first time the Düsseldorf-based artist has shown new work on such a monumental scale since his show at the gallery in 2012.

 Schütte works across various mediums to explore themes of cultural memory, existential struggle, and the human striving for an impossible utopian ideal. His mastery of gesture, material, and shifts in scale are evident throughout his oeuvre, regardless of the medium he chooses.

 In the current exhibition, a series of new bronzes in four different scales explore new iterations of one of Schütte’s key images, the Mann im Matsch [Man in Mud]. The smallest of these new works to be on view is only some inches tall, and the largest are three individual bronze figures, each of these about 12 feet tall. These largest works introduce a new subject, Man in the Wind, but reference Man in Mud, the subject of which was Schütte’s first figurative work (1982/1983). That image originated with a small plastic toy that Schütte chose to cast in a box up to its knees to prevent it from continually falling over. This technical solution lead to a deeply effective and metaphoric image. The figurine was transformed into a representation of a wanderer stuck in a trackless terrain while attempting to fulfill an unknown assignment. Schütte sees this figure, which is held in by its own material and is thus incapable of moving forward, as a sort of allegory to the failure of the modern fixation on history’s constant progress.

 Schütte has recently had solo exhibitions at Oldenburger Kunstverein, Germany (2018), Moderna Museet, Stockholm (2017), Fondation Beyeler, Riehen, Switzerland (2013-2014), Museum Folkwang, Essen, Germany (2013), and Serpentine Gallery, London (2012). He has had three retrospectives held in Bonn (2010), Madrid (2010), and Munich (2009). His work is included in the permanent collections of major international museums including: Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid; Tate, London; Dallas Museum of Art; Art Institute of Chicago; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; and Museum of Modern Art, New York. Thomas Schütte was born in 1954 in Oldenburg, Germany; he lives and works in Düsseldorf.

Lisson Gallery presents an exhibition of new and historic work by Carmen Herrera, the first ever large-scale presentation of the artist’s Estructuras. Based on paintings “really crying out to become sculpture”, Herrera’s Estructuras represent a rare break in Herrera’s insistent planarity and rectangular container of her paintings. The exhibition at Lisson will feature twelve of these works, as well as sketches and drawings, and marks Herrera’s seventh show with the gallery.

Lisson Gallery presents an exhibition of new work by Texas-born, New York-based artist Hugh Hayden. Hayden’s work investigates natural and artificial means of identification. From early works featuring hair, feathers, tree bark and clothing to recent sculptures created from salvaged Christmas trees, Hayden begins with objects which inherently carry significant associations with societal categorization: race, religion, ethnicity, education, sexuality and the like. This show marks the artist’s first exhibition with the gallery and will feature sculpture created from wood indigenous to the United States and Mexico border, exploring notions of citizenship, manifest destiny and the contested boundaries between people and nations.

<![CDATA[
Hauser &amp; Wirth present ‘Study for Self Reflection,’ Turner prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger’s first solo exhibition with the gallery in the United States. One of Britain’s foremost contemporary artists, Wallinger is recognized for his rich and complex body of work, spanning painting, sculpture, installation, printmaking, video, performance, and photography. This exhibition features new paintings and two large-scale sculptures presented for the first time to an American audience. The works on view extend Wallinger’s career-long engagement with ideas of power, authority, artifice, and illusion. The theme of reflection is central to Wallinger’s oeuvre; the artist deploys it to probe questions about the psyche and the self, and to challenge our attachment to our identities and the socio-cultural mechanisms that inform them.

 Entering the gallery, visitors are confronted with ‘Superego’ (2016), a sculpture composed of a mirrored triangular prism rotating atop a post. Inspired by the revolving New Scotland Yard sign, which marks the entrance of London’s police headquarters, ‘Superego’ directly references this symbol of authority; Wallinger interprets the sign’s constant motion as the unremitting and omniscient eye of law enforcement. In distilling this totem, Wallinger produces an enigmatic symbol of intimidation and dominance. While the sculpture’s seductive surface appeals to our own desire for self-reflection and recognition, its position above viewers’ heads denies direct access to our mirrored image.

 Moving through the gallery, viewers encounter ‘Self Reflection’ (2016) suspended from the ceiling. First exhibited at the nal home of Sigmund Freud in London, ‘Self Reflection’ was originally installed in the psychoanalyst’s study, which houses all the books, objects, and furnishings, including the famous couch, that Freud brought with him when fleeing Vienna in 1938. Wallinger’s intervention effectively displaced each totem and object and doubled the space with unnerving clarity. For this exhibition, Wallinger has transplanted the artwork to the gallery, installing it at the exact height as the ceiling in Freud’s study and retaining the same orientation. The austere space references Freud’s Viennese study on Berggasse 19, left empty after his forced departure from Austria. ‘The mirror exists without the bene t of my acknowledgement or scrutiny, my absence or presence. ‘I was expecting you’ it seems to say. But it is always expecting me,’ Wallinger writes.

 Through an adjacent doorway, visitors encounter Wallinger’s suite of new Mirror Paintings (2018). These works follow his earlier id Paintings (2015 – 16) and Self-Portrait series (2007 – 2015). The dimensions of these tactile canvases are based on the artist’s own height and arm span. Through the use of silver paint applied with the artist’s hands in freeform gestures these new works represent a further fetishized encounter with the canvas. The memory of his touch is suspended in the substance of the paintings. Their surfaces are insistently sculptural, tracing his hand and fingerprints, asserting direct and immediate engagement. They also take on an unpredictable illusory quality as the material sets. This transformation infuses the paintings with ‘a quality of otherness,’ a sense of elusiveness that Wallinger likens to gazing through the surface of water.

 Accompanying these large-scale Mirror Paintings is a small black-and-white photograph of Claude Monet from 1904. In this self-portrait, the artist’s shadowy reflection appears to gaze back from the quiet depths of a lily pond, just out of reach, conjuring the myth of Narcissus within his most celebrated subject. The exhibition’s recurring theme of reflection and perception is also embodied in ‘Statue (Fragment)’ (2018), a bronze cast of Wallinger’s spectacles. Rendered opaque, the lenses suggest the gelid tribute of commemorative sculpture and recall ‘Blind Faith,’ the alter-ego Wallinger assumed in earlier works such as the Speaking in Tongues trilogy (1997 – 1999) and ‘Word in the Desert’ (2000).

 Public works are an integral part of Wallinger’s practice. Hauser &amp; Wirth is pleased to exhibit a small-scale sculptural rendering of the focal point of his major architectural project ‘Writ in Water’ (2018). Commissioned by the National Trust UK and produced in collaboration with architects Studio Octopi, the work commemorates the 800th anniversary of the sealing of Magna Carta at Runnymede and draws inspiration from the fundamental principles of justice it embodies. Upon entering the completed project, visitors will navigate left or right around an outer passage that leads to a central chamber comprised of a circular pool of water beneath a wide oculus. Inscribed along the inner side of the pool is the reversed and inverted lettering of Clause 39 of Magna Carta, so that one reads the text reflected in the water. The clause is considered the basis of common law in Britain and the due process of law in the 5th Amendment: ‘No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land.’

 About the Artist

 Mark Wallinger is one of the UK’s leading artists. Having previously been nominated for the Turner Prize in 1995, he won in 2007 for his installation ‘State Britain.’ ‘Ecce Homo’ (1999) was the first work to occupy the empty plinth in Trafalgar Square. He represented Britain at the Venice Biennale in 2001. ‘Labyrinth’ (2013), a major and permanent commission for Art on the Underground, was created to celebrate 150 years of the London Underground, and in 2019 ‘The World Turned Upside Down’ will be realized for the London School of Economics.

 Wallinger has held solo exhibitions at the Serpentine Gallery, London, England (1995); Portikus, Hamburg, Germany (1999); Museum fur Gegenwartskunst, Basel, Switzerland (1999); Palais Des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, Belgium (1999); Tate Liverpool, Liverpool, England (2000); Vienna Secession, Vienna, Austria (2000); Whitechapel Gallery, London, England (2001) Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin, Germany (2004); Museo de Arte Carillo Gil, Mexico City, Mexico (2005); Tate Britain, England (2007); Kunstverein Braunschweig, Braunschweig, Germany (2007); Aargauer Kunsthaus, Aarau, Switzerland (2008); Kunstnernes Hus, Oslo, Norway (2010); Museum de Pont, Tilburg, Netherlands (2011); BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead, England (2012); Serlachius Museum, Mänttä, Finland (2016); The Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh, Scotland (2017); Dundee Contemporary Arts, Dundee, Scotland (2017) and Centro per l’Arte Contemporanea Luigi Pecci, Prato, Italy (2018). His work is displayed in the collections of many leading international museums including Tate, London, England; MoMA, New York, US; and Centre Pompidou, Paris, France.

Encompassing free-standing sculptures, mobiles and installations, Strange Roots is Jesse Krimes’ second solo show with Burning in Water Gallery.

 The artworks in Strange Roots embody a curious hybridity of both materials and processes, incorporating digitally-printed plastic substrates, botanicals and other natural materials and handblown glass.

 During his time in prison - a significant period of which was spent in solitary confinement - Krimes used his artwork as a means of scrutinizing the intersections between individual and collective identities, the impact of mass media on socio-cultural perceptions and the coercive power of the state.

 5 years have passed since his 6 years prison sentence ended. And in Strange Roots, he now centers these concerns largely on “the invisible cloud of the internet,” which he considers to be a space “where traces of social protocols, interactions and ghosts are captured, archived and processed through the lens of cultural value.”

A retrospective exhibition of metal sculpture by Richard Stankiewicz (1922-1983) will include free standing and wall pieces constructed by the artist from materials he found in junkyards.

 Stankiewicz was one of a group of artists in the 1950s who produced “city art” reflecting an urban culture. Their work evoked a certain wit, irony and an implied critique by the artists of the decade’s sudden affluence and material wealth after World War II.

Project:ARTspace presents New York artist Kevin Sudeith in Knight Errant, his second solo exhibition with the gallery. Sudeith is showcasing videos and large-scale impressions made from an expedition to Iceland earlier this year.

 For the past ten years, Sudeith has led a wandering life. He travels in a white van visiting rural communities and creating immovable carvings. His subjects are always life like, iconic imagery of local cultures and environments. This has been done in pursuit of bringing art to communities that seem so far from it and at the same time, Sudeith is questing for champions of his art. The nature of traveling and making immovable works has made Sudeith’s pieces take on qualities that are charitable, social, and timeless.

 For Knight Errant three large impressions of his Icelandic horsemen are the highlight. The impressions taken from the carving are heavily embossed on handmade paper. They capture the image and sculptural depth of the carving in minute detail. These are the largest pieces made by Sudeith to date and mark a significant development in his process. The impressions are accompanied by one, time-lapse video that documents him carving stones and making impressions at multiple sites. These videos give a rare glance at the final carving and the day to day operations of the artist.

 Sudeith’s carvings, or petroglyphs, take on many roles. As site-specific public pieces, they are beautiful and act as permanent historical markers playing with the ideas of culture and time. Sudeith uses the carvings to create handmade impressions which he calls, his paintings, to explore contemporary image making. Lastly holding printmaking and papermaking workshops he engages with communities providing education and moments of sharing, even allowing people to take home a rubbing.

 Kevin Sudeith is a knight errant. He travels in search of historical fame and fortune thought his deeds as an artist. Like many wandering adventures he battles more with the elements and finds little of what he set out for. Yet, Sudeith is leaving behind a trail of wonderful relationships and is enriching the world with thoughtful objects about us.

 Sudeith (b. 1965, St. Paul, MN) received a BFA from the San Francisco Art Institute and an MFA from the School of Visual Arts in New York City, where he has lived for the past 25 years. His work has been most recently exhibited at Pulse Miami Beach in, 2017, Mike Weiss Gallery, 2016 and the North Highland Museum in Canada, 2013. Sudeith has been making public carvings since 2003 and has many permanent installations including Rockaway Beach, New York, Grand Rapids, Michigan and Smelt Brook, Nova Scotia. Sudeith is currently ‘at large’, traveling and making petroglyphs.

Drea Cofield’s new body of work draws inspiration from literary sources, including the story of the Lotus Eaters from Homer’s Odyssey. In the epic poem, the hero Odysseus encounters a tribe of lotus-eaters on his return to Ithaka. The flowers and fruits—possessing a narcotic quality—overcame those who ate them with lethargy and a blissful forgetfulness. Cofield expanded on this ancient metaphor of forgetting cultural rules to depict what she calls “an amoral Eden,” where nude figures exist and interact with one another in a hedonistic, alternate reality. Instead of illustrating Homer’s story literally, Cofield developed a mythological voice of her own to describe her fictitious world and the characters who inhabit it.

Valerie Goodman Gallery presents the second solo show of the acclaimed furniture and interior designer Tinatin Kilaberidze. Known for her simultaneously rigorous and opulent furniture and accessories, the Georgian-born artist - whose many facets include a background in literature and architecture - will display her new pieces.

 “I would rather live in a convent than in a disorganized place,” says Tinatin Kilaberidze: her designs express just this passion for clarity. Most of her furniture is made of straight angles and perfect circles. But purity is only a point of departure: “When you start out from there, you leave room for emotions.” The many narrowly spaced panels at the base of her very long bench mimic the steady rhythm of a colonnade and evoke a sense of solidity but also of a kind of grandeur: the generous use of fine wood defies the utter sobriety of her design with joy of abundance. With the padding pressed tightly against their woolen skins, Kilabertidze’s curvaceous lounge chair and its attendant foot-rest seem to bask in their voluptuous sensuality, —reveling equally in their rich materiality and counter-linearity. Kilaberidze’s oak dining room chair presents a starkly rectangular front while its hind-legs widen unexpectedly towards the ground, bringing to mind an elegant, minimalist shoe with an extravagant heel. The chair’s creamy white silk cushions speak the same language of barely restrained luxury as its meticulously crafted, bony frame.

 It is always wood, fabric, and metal that have the first and the last word: Kilaberidze devotes a great amount of time to selecting and refining her materials, especially wood. The designer uses no stains or lacquers. “The life of the object is in the grain of the wood, its color and tactility. She appreciates three esthetic elements she in nature —simplicity, geometry, and balance. To those she adds contrast as well as an edge of drama by exaggerating conventional proportions. However, Kilaberidze never finds her own modernist philosophy in contradiction to a love for the organic. The principles of nature are also at work, for example, in her bronze standing lamps: just like a plant’s roots, leaves and blossoms evolve from the same genetic program, the black patina of the lamp’s foot and stem are just a variation of its polished, golden head.

Allan Stone Projects presents Grand Salon: The Visionary Eye of Allan Stone. Allan Stone (1932-2006), the renowned dealer and collector, amassed one of the most expansive private collections in the history of contemporary art. The exhibition celebrates Stone’s voracious appetite for acquiring works by artists who eventually became icons of the era, such as Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline, as well as lesser-known artists of significant talent such as Kazuko Inoue and Peter Dean. Fine art objects across all media are included in the exhibition which illuminate Stone’s passion for collecting. “It’s all about vibrations, the vibrations I sense when I see a truly great work of art. To me, the real thing gives off the right energy.” *
 *Cameron, Donna. “Allan Stone: Ahead of the Curve,” Manhattan Arts, Spring 1995 p. 6.

 Stone’s commitment to supporting new talent resulted in over three hundred exhibitions in his gallery, which he opened in 1960. He gave first or early shows to Wayne Thiebaud (1962), Eva Hesse (1963), Jack Whitten (1965), Richard Estes (1968) in addition to masters such as John Chamberlain, Joseph Cornell and Alfred Leslie. While some artists went on to achieve international recognition, Stone championed over one hundred and fifty emerging artists in his career as a gallerist. He formed strong relationships akin to that of a patron with artists such as Robert Baribeau, David Beck and Lorraine Shemesh, whom he represented for decades.

 Stone’s origins as a collector began with his first purchase of a Willem de Kooning drawing when he was a freshman at Harvard University. As a student, the purchase was a significant risk. De Kooning was not yet a household name but Stone acted on his instincts and collected what he loved. He applied that same fervor to numerous artists to whom he gave strong encouragement. Stone was known for his innovative exhibitions that often featured established and lesser-known artists in conjunction with each other, creating a new dialogue between them and their different perspectives. Professionally as well as personally, Stone sustained an authentic reaction to art and its potential to change and enhance life throughout his illustrious career.

 Artists in the exhibition include James P. Aponovich, Robert Baribeau, David Beck, William Beckman, Barton Benes, Dennis Clive, Barry Cohen, Gordon Cook, Joseph Cornell, Willem de Kooning, Peter Dean, George Deem, Steven Durkee, Richard Estes, Peter Gee, John Gibson, John Graham, Dorothy Grebenak, Derrick Guild, James Havard, Kazuko Inoue, Franz Kline, Bernard Langlais, Don Nice, Wayne Nowack, Philadelphia Wire Man, Edith Schloss, Lorraine Shemesh, Roy Superior, Wayne Thiebaud, Domenick Turturro and John Vickery.

United States and constitutes a twenty-year survey of his ongoing Pink Man series, which contains some of the most recognizable and visually arresting contemporary photographic images from Southeast Asia. The exhibited photographs range from 1997, the first year of the series, to never before seen 2018 images, shown alongside video and installation works.

 Born in 1961 in Bangkok, Thailand, where he continues to live and work, Manit received his BA in Visual Art from Bangkok’s Srinakharinwirot University in 1984. His commitment to social activism developed while still a student, and during the 1980s he established himself as a photo-journalist, working for an international news service to document Thailand’s volatile political scene and rapidly developing consumer culture. Always with an artist’s sensitivity to the interplay between the sensuousness of surface aesthetics and the emotional and ideological contents they embody, he sought to develop a deeper critique that could convey what he calls “emotional truth” while giving free rein to his urge toward visual exuberance. These various currents coalesced in the mid-1990s with the Pink Man series in which a portly man, embodied by Thai poet Sompong Thawee, dressed in a hot pink suit and pushing a similarly colored shopping cart, inserts himself into various aspects of Thai life, mutely lampooning consumer culture. The catastrophic financial crisis that hit Thailand in 1998 brought greater urgency, and a more pointed critique, to the series, which has continued to the present day, chronicling an increasingly jarring sequence of social tensions, political unrest, and coups d’état. “I found that the character took on a life of its own – one of the reasons being the audience response to it,” Manit explains. “And, as an art piece, it can continue because it is still making social commentary. It’s like a cartoon character, like Batman or something. When some trouble crops up, he comes to the rescue. In the case of Pink Man, he has become a reflection of current events in our society. I see the character as reflecting an entire era.”

 Manit came onto the international art scene twenty years ago, with his participation in the 1998 Bienal International de Sao Paulo, and he has shown regularly around the world ever since. In 2003, his work was featured in Thailand’s first pavilion at the Venice Biennale, and a mid-career survey, Phenomena &amp; Prophecies, was presented at the Singapore Art Museum in 2010. The scope of his work extends far beyond Pink Man, and he has produced diverse bodies of work ranging from intimate portraits of his neighbors, to eerie images of the effigies of revered Buddhist monks, to scenes of urban riots and street demonstrations – all conveyed with what has been called a unique “combination of technical virtuosity, ambivalence, and depth of feeling with a strange, childlike directness.” He has a deep interest in the history of photography and its role in Thai culture, and, along with his wife, filmmaker Ing K, he established Kathmandu Gallery, Bangkok’s leading photography gallery and bookshop, which presents rotating exhibitions of contemporary and historic photography

Matthew Marks presents Anne Truitt Paintings featuring eleven works on canvas made between 1974 and 1993, this is the largest exhibition of Truitt’s paintings since the 1970s.

 Known primarily for her totemic wood sculptures painted in subtle shades of color, Truitt also made innovative paintings for more than three decades. Rarely seen during her lifetime (only one of the works in this exhibition has been shown before), Truitt’s paintings juxtapose fields of rich color applied in multiple layers using a masking technique Truitt first developed in the 1960s. One of the largest paintings in the exhibition, the nine-foot-wide Engadine I (1990), features two shades of purplish black divided along a sharp vertical border that bisects the composition into unequal yet optically balanced halves.

 Despite her pared-down formal vocabulary, which has garnered comparisons to Minimalism, Truitt’s fundamental concern was expression: “I’ve struggled all my life to get maximum meaning in the simplest possible form.” This can be seen in her attentiveness not only to each painting’s color and composition but also to its material support. In Messenger, Prodigal, and Morning Wave (all 1986) she has accentuated the verticality of each painting — eight feet tall but just eight and a half inches wide — by tacking the canvas to the back of the stretchers and extending the composition around the painting’s sides. In later works, including Prospect (1991), she used rounded stretcher bars that curl inward to give the painting a curved bevel along its perimeter. This tension between two and three dimensionality is a central element in Truitt’s paintings and sculptures. Through this interplay between pictorial effects and material support, she manifested the metaphysical meaning in her art — or, as she described it, “the sharp delight of watching what has been inside one’s own most intimate self materialize into visibility.”

 The exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue with an essay by Michael Schreyach.

 Anne Truitt (1921–2004) lived and worked in Washington, DC. Her work has been the subject of one-person exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art (1973–74), the Corcoran Gallery of Art (1974), the Baltimore Museum of Art (1974 and 1992), and the National Gallery of Art (2017–18). In 2009 the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, DC, organized a comprehensive survey of her sculpture. In 2013 the three volumes of her acclaimed journals, Daybook (1982), Turn (1986), and Prospect (1996), were published together for the first time in e-book and audiobook formats, alongside a new print edition of Daybook. Last year an installation of Truitt’s paintings and sculptures opened at Dia:Beacon, where it remains on long-term view.

Matthew Marks presents Paul Sietsema, the next exhibition in his gallery at 523 West 24th Street. The exhibition features new paintings, drawings, and a 16mm film.

 For one group of paintings, Sietsema worked with found abstract paintings by anonymous artists that he purchased at local auctions in Europe. He tore up bills of different euro denominations and scanned them. The images of the currency as it fell onto the scanner were then painted by hand in a photorealistic manner on top of the abstractions. The layering and materiality of these paintings point to assemblage and earlier avant-garde aesthetics. Sietsema has also expressed interest in making physical the symbolic value of currency.

 In another series of canvases, Sietsema has painted images of rotary telephones in monochromatic tones. The receiver lies beside the phone’s base in a manner the artist has stated can be read as either an open line of communication or a dead line. To make these works, he first mixed paint to match the original color of each telephone. He then poured the mixture over the phone, coating it in a pool of paint. The paint-covered phone was then photographed, and the resulting image file was painted by hand on the canvas. Sietsema describes the rotary phone as an artifact that was once an object of pure utility and thus invisible, but which now has a highly sculptural and iconographic quality due to its obsolescence.

 Two ink drawings in the exhibition depict newspaper advertisements for luxury credit cards: black, gold, and titanium. The cards utilize an iconography based on outdated associations of gold and other metals as a standard of value. Images of dollar coins dripping in black enamel have been painted on top of the newspaper ad. The coins appear to have been tossed onto the image, simulating a type of expressive mark historically associated with value in painting. The tag line of one ad reads, “Heavy Metal,” employing a formerly subversive genre to sell a mainstream financial product.

 The 16mm film, Encre Chine (2012), presents a range of studio-related objects covered in a viscous black printer’s ink. The film moves between close-ups of the objects — a disassembled picture frame, a film canister, a paintbrush, a camera — and broader shots of a studio mise-en-scène. The artist states, “The ink is a democratizing agent that renders all objects as pure image. It is like photographic emulsion. It introduces a material link between earthly functional objects and the world of images and image production.”

 Displayed throughout the exhibition are large silk-screened paintings on linen based on decades-old posters from commercial gallery exhibitions for Pablo Picasso, Jean Dubuffet, and Louise Bourgeois. The posters have been made into monochrome images by screening the background color from each over its graphic content. A slight shift in register allows the original image to bleed through the screened dots. Regarding these works Sietsema has said he is interested in “the assumed timeless quality of these masterworks locked into the tastes of another time and painted over with the colors of their pre-digital promotional apparatus.”

 Paul Sietsema (born 1968) lives and works in Los Angeles. He has had one-person exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; the Museo Nacional Centro de Art Reina Sofia, Madrid; and the Kunsthalle Basel, among others.

Matthew Marks presents Suellen Rocca Drawings, the next exhibition in his gallery at 526 West 22nd Street.

 Suellen Rocca is one of the original members of the Hairy Who, the influential group of six Chicago artists who exhibited together for five years in the 1960s. This show, the first to concentrate on Rocca’s works on paper, presents thirty drawings she made between 1981 and 2017. Building on the unique graphic vocabulary and innovative compositions of her 1960s work, these drawings represent a turn toward imagery she describes as “more internal.” Animals, trees, and unclassifiable creatures are placed in densely patterned settings that carry a genuine emotional charge.

 The exhibition is accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue. In the essay, Cat Kron notes Rocca’s “increased attention to the unconscious,” tracing parallels between the artist’s “anxious imaginings” and the automatic drawing of the Surrealists. As Rocca puts it, “I just begin, and the drawing is a journey between me and the marks on the paper.”

 Suellen Rocca was born in Chicago in 1943 and currently lives in Romeoville, Illinois. Shortly after graduating from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1964, she began showing her paintings, drawings, and sculptures alongside those of her fellow Hairy Who members. The group’s exhibitions drew national and international attention and went on to influence generations of artists. In 2016, Matthew Marks Gallery presented Rocca’s first one-person exhibition in New York, “Suellen Rocca: Bare Shouldered Beauty, Works from 1965 to 1969.” Her work will be featured in the exhibition “Hairy Who? 1966–1969”, the first major survey of the group’s work, which opens at the Art Institute of Chicago on September 26.

<![CDATA[
american medium presents Touchstone, an exhibition of sculpture and painting by Ivana Bašić, Caitlin Cherry, Zack Davis, Jo Nigoghossian, Andrew Ross, and Vincent Tiley. These artists are exploring the human condition; employing traditional art-making practices, contemporary technology, and a sensitivity to the anthropomorphic aesthetics these tools have acquired. The artworks in Touchstone orbit around the concept of the noosphere “…[an] imagining, in one way or another, above the animal biosphere, a human sphere, a sphere of reflection, a conscious invention, of conscious souls,” - Telihard de Chardin, “Hominization” (1923).

 In the context of this exhibition de Chardin’s “soul” can be taken to mean self-awareness or sentience. The artworks, though inanimate, possess qualities familiar to animals, humans - and more recently - to neural networks, and artificial intelligences. These objects were gifted self awareness by their makers and allowed to reflect themselves. They are present, purposeful, and knowledgeable, yet obviously inhuman. Although composed of familiar elements populating our everyday, these artworks seem to beckon to a world beyond our senses.

 In the Turing test, a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior becomes indistinguishable from that of a human. It is in our mind that an AI becomes human; it is in the viewer’s mind that these artworks become animate. From collections of steel, glass, resin, and pigment, a “soul” emerges. These artworks are reminders that there are touchstones used to interpret reality other than those we are most familiar with. In the words of the scholar Graham Harvey, “…the world is full of persons, only some of whom are human.”

<![CDATA[
There is a narrative undercurrent to Stephanie London’s still life paintings that give a sense that her arranged objects are like actors on a stage. Sourcing her objects from thrift stores, eBay, or flea markets, they have an inherent nostalgic history to them, and as they are used again and again in her paintings, they become a familiar cast of characters. London’s prolonged study of these objects is apparent in their composition, for there is not only evidence of a finely attuned observation to how they work with one another in light, color, shape, and mood, but the space around and between them bristles with a mysterious energy over how they may relate in their uncanny juxtaposition. This intuitive process lends a sense of London’s hand and subconscious, giving the scene a touch of surrealism.

 The paintings are quietly expressive, with a somber palette contrasted with an emphasis on light. A minimalist by nature, London is pushing herself with this latest body of work to imbue more complexity into her scenes with more objects and greater atmospheric details. Rather than placing these objects in an ambiguous ground, she is creating a specific place. With some of the paintings on view in Just Below the Surface, she uses segments of Picasso’s “Guernica” as a background. A favorite painting of London’s, this enables her to further understand and pay tribute to the painting, as well as to create a contrast between the bold, intense, and active imagery with the more tranquil scene and delicate objects.

 London has been a practicing Buddhist for over thirty years, and considers both the act of creating a painting and viewing a painting to be a meditative experience. The art of arranging, portraying, and studying these scenes is a way to calm the storm within, and to provide a moment of quiet contemplation and beauty in a frequently harsh and tumultuous world.

 Stephanie London has exhibited throughout the United States including the Provincetown Art Museum, Palm Springs Desert Museum, and Barnsdall Art Park. She was the recipient of the Lillian Orlowsky and William Freed Foundation Grant. She holds a MFA from Claremont College, and lives and works in California.

Josette Urso’s paintings are driven by a sense of urgency. Working from her observations of her surrounding environment, her inspiration is in a constant state of flux as the light, weather, and elements of any given scene changes as she works. Whether working in plein air during her travels or looking out over her sweeping view of Brooklyn from her studio, Urso responds to the shapes, forms, light, and experience of place and seeks to capture that in heavily worked, frenetic abstraction.

 Urso begins with broad sweeps of color, paralleling the flow of energy throughout a space. Then she moves to more specific marks, often prompted by a detail from her surroundings that has grabbed hold of her in particular. This process is intuitive and exploratory. Urso turns the canvas as she works, always looking for surprising directions and unexpected juxtapositions. She thrives on the not knowing, and the journey of discovery within her own work.

 In recent years, Urso has expanded her sense of space. She contends with both nearness and distance within the same plane, and regularly explores the middle ground between inside and outside. She draws from both organic materials as well as manmade objects and structures, contrasting perhaps a natural form with a synthetic color. Using thick brushstrokes, the tactile nature of her marks gives a further sense of depth and space, as well as a sense that the painting is an object itself. There is a playful rhythm and bright palette that mirrors Urso’s energy and the atmospheres she seeks out.

 Josette Urso has exhibited widely throughout the United States and around the world, including at the Bronx Museum of Art, the Painting Center, the Tampa Museum of Art, the Museo de las Americas in Puerto Rico, and the New York Public Library. She has been the recipient of numerous grants, awards, and fellowships including from the Pollock-Krasner Foundation, the Ballinglen Arts Foundation in Ireland, the Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation, the Ruth and Harold Chenven Foundation, Basil H. Alkazzi, Loft Nota Bene in Spain, Camargo in France, Ucross in Wyoming and Yaddo in Saratoga Springs, NY. She has an MFA in painting from the University of South Florida, and lives and works in Brooklyn, NY.

<![CDATA[
Skarstedt presents Lineage: de Kooning and His Influence, an exhibition illuminating the impact of Willem de Kooning’s late works on a select group of artists working today. However expansive de Kooning’s reach, this exhibition explores his influence on six significant contemporary artists: Joe Bradley, George Condo, Brice Marden, Albert Oehlen, Sue Williams, and Christopher Wool.

 In the late 1980’s, with a renewal of focus and vision, de Kooning became “aware of his own mortality and the fragility of painting itself [and] applied himself with all deliberate speed to forge a lasting legacy” (J. Zilczer, “Chapter 5: Looking Back,” A Way of Living: The Art of Willem de Kooning, New York, Phaidon, 2014, p. 232). Not only did de Kooning diverge from figuration to abstraction, but he also changed materials and method of applying paint, in a way that showed his awareness of longevity and conservation, proving his new-found awareness of his place within art history. Redirecting his approach to painting in this final chapter, de Kooning’s canvases became spare with sinuous lines of primary colors with loops and linear forms articulated across a white ground. This minimal and sharpened composition has been revisited and reconsidered in a variety of ways by some of the most important artists working today.

 Albert Oehlen openly declares de Kooning his greatest source of inspiration in the history of abstract art (Albert Oehlen in an interview with Glenn O’Brien, “Albert Oehlen” Interview Magazine, April 24, 2009). His work, Bild und Auge (1996-2000), comes from his Computer Paintings series, which Oehlen began in the early 1990’s. This body of work is considered a tipping point in the artist’s career and earned Oehlen the reputation of “technician of freedom” dedicated to overcoming the limitations of both materiality and form. Using a similar off-white background to de Kooning’s paintings, Oehlen creates new kinds of looping forms using computer generated gestures. While reinventing traditional means of representation, Oehlen’s computer painting picks up where de Kooning left off, reinterpreting the line altogether.

 George Condo’s painting Abstract with Black and White Lines (2018) is similarly laden with evidence of de Kooning’s influence. While de Kooning and contemporary artists forged deeper into the realm of abstraction, Condo deviated and chose to investigate and challenge traditional perceptions of the figure. Abstract with Black and White Lines (2018) embodies Condo’s belief that the task of the artist is to “create a unified presence of all presences” and “to define the object which is both real and artificial and liberate it from invisibility” (K. Ottmann, “Becoming Condo,” The Way I Think, The Phillips Collection, 2017 p. 15). By blurring the boundaries between abstraction and reality, the work pays tribute to the revolutionary spirit of de Kooning while simultaneously fashioning a legacy of its own.

 By considering the last decade of de Kooning’s oeuvre as a distillation of his life’s work alongside Bradley, Condo, Marden, Oehlen, Williams, and Wool, the similarities in contour, brushwork, and can be traced to a consequent generation of painters, thus furthering the legacy of one of the 20th Century’s most original and influential artists.

Bryce Wolkowitz Gallery present Icons, its first exhibition with Zurich-based artist duo Jojakim Cortis and Adrian Sonderegger.

 In Icons, Cortis and Sonderegger have amassed an argument for the validity of material illusion in photography, a take that both references and undermines world history while gleefully derailing the popular icons we think we know, from the very genesis of photography to the brink of the digital era.

 Sourcing imagery from illustrious photographers such as Edward Steichen, Jacques-Henri Lartigue, and Robert Frank, as well as mythic images from pop culture and historical events; Cortis and Sonderegger create an instantly recognizable simulacrum of a narrative. Imagistic catastrophes like the Hindenburg going up in flames and the tsunami of 2004 crashing onto a beachside resort are posited alongside touchstones from the history of photography as in William Eggleston’s celebrated dye transfer The Red Ceiling (1973) and Nicéphore Niépce’s View from the Window at Le Gras (1826), the oldest surviving photograph.

 Deception and illusion, materials mimicking reality, ever at the heart of photography, merge and are magnified in these confounding images. All of the potency and timing and tragedy of these very specific photographs are reduced to ephemeral sculptures in a studio. The photographic setting reveals the construction of the model itself, creating an image inside of an image, and allows for history to be seen from a contemporary perspective. We see the Loch Ness Monster on a sea of cellophane with little more than a spray bottle and a few well-placed lights to recreate the blisteringly cryptic, and also staged, Surgeon’s Photograph (1934). A hot glue gun lies poised beneath a model of Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima, the glue gun just as important as the flag and the soldier’s helmets, a nudging reminder that the means of imagery are just as often the true levers of power.

 Just as every iconic photograph has a backstory, Cortis and Sonderegger re-dramatize the performativity of the original photographs, doubling and complicating the meaning of an aesthetic arrangement. With the casual effort and fetishistic detail of Glessner Lee’s crime scene maquettes or Thomas Demand’s illusory environments, these makeshift reconstructions serve to transform and extend their source material. They are both irreverent and accurate to the point of astonishing detail. Cortis and Sonderegger’s images are thus absurdly delightful, surprising, mischievous, and simply fun to look at. They are the types of pictures one can look at forever, pictures of pictures scratched out of thin air, invoking the alchemy of the artists in their atelier, remaking history with invisible hands and some Scotch tape, a wire brush and scissors.

 Jojakim Cortis (b. 1978, Germany) and Adrian Sonderegger (b. 1980, Switzerland) live and work in Zurich. Their collaboration began in 2005 while studying photography at the Zurich University of the Arts. They have been exhibiting internationally since 2007, including shows at the Swiss Foundation of Photography, Winterthur (2018), East-Wing Gallery, Dubai (2016) and Museum Folkwang, Essen (2014). Their monograph “Double Take”, published by Thames &amp; Hudson, was released in June 2018.

Curator: Dr. Myrah Brown Green


 FiveMyles presents the first solo exhibition in Brooklyn of the photographs by the esteemed and beloved photographer/artist Jamel Shabazz.

 This journalistic timeline documents almost forty years of historical moments photographed by Jamel Shabazz. These include images of the hip hop culture, the Native American community, the Masonic experiences, the Rastafarian Family and Shabazz’ iconic subway rides.

 Mr. Shabazz, through the lens of his camera, has looked at New York and New Yorkers with sympathy and an extraordinary sense of moment for four decades. His photographs have been a source of pride to this complicated city, Shabzz’ images show its humanity, its big city callousness, its many faces and its humor.

 The curator Dr. Myrah Brown Green has especially chosen images that so clearly point to Shabazz’ feeling of being connected to those he photographs, and their moment of connection with him. Myrah Brown Green sees this exhibition as Jamel Shabazz’ personal square; this square we all inhabit, and into which we allow others to enter.

 Jamel Shabazz photographs have been shown among other prestigious venues at ArtBasel Miami, the Brooklyn Museum, the Bronx Museum, the Newark Museum, the Contact Photo Festival, the Victoria Albert Museum, Duke University and the Adidas Photo festival in Ethiopia.

 Dr. Myrah Brown Green is an art historian, author, lecturer, arts consultant and independent curator.

YARES ART presents Larry Poons: Ruffles Queequeg + The Throw Decade Paintings: 1971-1981, on view in New York, The show’s title refers to a character in Herman Melville’s Moby Dick, as well as to a pivotal painting in the oeuvre of one of America’s most important and influential artists, Larry Poons. A highlight of the exhibition, Ruffles Queequeg (1972) heralded Poons’s reemergence on the international art scene in the early 1970s as one of the most dynamic and significant leaders of the Color Field movement. While still in his twenties, Poons achieved considerable success and renown in the 1960s for abstract compositions, in the then-new medium of acrylic paint, featuring hard-edge colorful dots and lozenge shapes that pulsate against backgrounds of contrasting hues. One of the most inventive-and restless-artists of his generation, Poons heroically fought against the demands of art-world expectations and moved his art forward to explore novel techniques, processes, and materials. With the “Throw” paintings, which preoccupied him throughout the 1970s, he arrived at a lush and sensuous realm of painterly expression that had never been seen before.

 The artist’s second solo exhibition at Yares Art, New York, includes large-scale canvases, such as Johnson (1973), No More Greasy Boots Allowed in Here (1975), Rain of Terror, and Lycoming (both 1977), all masterful examples of the period. These works confront the viewer with innumerable cascades of pigment in countless hues. In his initial violent act of painting-throwing buckets of paint toward the top of the canvas and allowing the drips to flow down at will-the artist enlists as his accomplices in these works the laws of chance as well as gravity. With an insistent verticality, the compositions create hypnotic, and often meditative, optical effects that are not dissimilar from those found in Poons’s earlier dots and lozenge compositions.

 Ever changing and evolving, Poons, in subsequent decades, continued to experiment with new approaches and processes. The exhibition also includes a selection of his most recent works, such as Pictures in the Closet and Duco Walk (both 2018), painted with brushes and fingers. These luminous canvases prove that still at eighty years old, Poons continues to refine his extraordinary vision and redefine the possibilities of painting. As ever, his works challenge and impress audiences with their inimitable play of color, light, and movement.

 Born in Tokyo in 1937 to American parents, Poons relocated with his family to the United States at a young age, and studied music composition at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. Recognizing his greater talent for visual art, he transferred to the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where he studied painting. His career skyrocketed soon after he moved to New York in the early 1960s.

 Larry Poons’s work is included in many prominent public and private art collections throughout the world, including the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo; the Art Institute of Chicago; the Cleveland Museum of Art; the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, DC; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Philadelphia Museum of Art; the Georges Pompidou Center, Paris; the Santa Barbara Museum of Art; the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC; the Tate Modern, London; the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, Netherlands; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; and the Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, among other institutions.

 Larry Poons: Ruffles Queequeg + The Throw Decade Paintings: 1971-1981, is accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue with an introduction by Michael Fried and essays by Alex Bacon and Frank Stella.

Twenty-three vintage photographs by Brassaï from the collection of Madame Brassaï will be exhibited at Edwynn Houk Gallery. Of Madame Brassaï, Edwynn Houk wrote in Houk Friedman’s 1993 catalog Brassaï - The Eye of Paris, “For me, one of the greatest opportunities and privileges of the past decade has been to share in her intimate knowledge of Brassaï’s life and career, as well as to have been personally involved in some of the fundamental research into his art.” The selected works were all produced in the early 1930s and include rare photographs from the artist’s two most iconic books: Paris de Nuit, published in 1933, and Secret Paris of the 30s, which depicted such a provocative side of Parisian nightlife that the book was withheld from publication for more than four decades.

 Best known for his photographs taken during the 1930s, Brassaï took his most iconic photographs of Paris as the city transitioned between its Belle Epoque and Modern Era, including its conversion from gas to electric light. This era is amongst the richest periods of photography in the twentieth century, and Brassaï approached the time and its changes with particular distinction. His work shines light on the depth of nighttime as a subject itself, transforming the “cloak” of night into a stage for his subjects-as-archetypes.

 Brassaï’s genius lies in his ability to capture the hidden nightlife of the city as seen through the private backrooms, alleys, secret clubs, and bordellos that came alive after-hours. It is remarkable not only that he was admitted into these places with his photographic equipment, but also that his subjects accepted, trusted, and fully participated in his endeavors. While contemporaries such as Jacques Henri Lartigue and Robert Doisneau were photographing Paris as the romantic “City of Love” and emphasizing beauty and style, Brassaï’s photographs revealed a clandestine layer of Parisian life— previously restricted to the imagination of the public—brimming with vivid characters. Among his subjects were sex workers, gangsters, nightclub entertainers, artists, and other bohemians and marginalized figures. Brassaï “devoted himself to photographing all sorts of human beings… and he loved to preserve their ceremonies and rites. He evoked les étranges mœurs des hommes,” wrote Madame Brassaï.

 Brassaï (1899 – 1984) was born Gyula Halász in the Transylvanian town of Brasso, Hungary (today Romania). After passing through Berlin, the artist moved to Paris in 1924. There, he adopted his pseudonym, which means “from Brasso,” and supported himself as a journalist. His acquisition of a camera in 1930, in addition to a friendship with fellow Hungarian artist André Kertész, led Brassaï to devote himself to photography. Retrospectives of the artist’s work have been organized at the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; and most recently at Fundación MAPFRE’s Barcelona gallery, Casa Garriga i Nogués. This exhibition marks Edwynn Houk Gallery’s fourth solo show of Brassaï’s works.

Luhring Augustine Bushwick present Yasumasa Morimura: In the Room of Art History, the artist’s eighth solo show with the gallery.

 At the center of Morimura’s photographs is the artist himself in full disguise. For decades Morimura has challenged the conventions of self-portraiture by assuming the likeness of others, demonstrating the plasticity of identity. His approach to image-making stems from a desire to step into and inhabit pictorial space. Using props, makeup, costumes, and digital manipulation, Morimura embodies the personas of prominent figures in history, art, and entertainment as they are represented in popular visual culture. Finding inspiration predominantly within Western iconography, Morimura recasts his subjects and considers his own internalization of the imagery, a reflection of the influx of Western culture in the postwar era in his native Japan. Though his images are not exact duplicates, they bear an uncanny resemblance to their respective sources, operating in a space in which fiction blends with reality, and thereby disrupting the audience’s preexisting associations of the depicted subjects.

 In the Room of Art History presents examples from two bodies of Morimura’s work: Self-Portraits through Art History (2016), in which the artist has derived his imagery from iconic masterpieces by Caravaggio, Vermeer, Magritte, and van Gogh; and his seminal One Hundred M’s self-portraits (1993-2000), where he emulates celebrities such as Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, and Brigitte Bardot. In these works, Morimura presents intimate encounters with the artists and actors by reimagining their environments. In Self-Portraits through Art History, Morimura animates the paintings by expanding the frame, often inviting the viewer to witness a quiet moment just before or after the original scene. Similarly in One Hundred M’s self-portraits, through employing close up glamour shots and behind-the-scenes images, Morimura draws the viewer into an imagined private sphere where they shift between the roles of admirer, voyeur, and welcome friend.

 Concurrent with Luhring Augustine’s exhibition, Japan Society will present Yasumasa Morimura: Ego Obscura (October 12, 2018 – January 13, 2019), the artist’s first solo institutional exhibition in New York City. Curated by Japan Society Gallery Director Yukie Kamiya, the exhibition showcases Morimura’s signature photographic self-portraits, and features the U.S. premieres of two of his newest works: his first feature-length video piece, Egó Sympósion, in which he embodies twelve master artists known for their self-portraits; and Egó Obscura, a multimedia cinematic installation developed from the performance work Morimura’s Nippon Cha Cha Cha!, which the artist will perform live at Japan Society on Saturday, October 13 (www.japansociety.org).

 Morimura (born in Osaka in 1951) has had recent solo exhibitions at the Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh; the Hara Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo, Japan; the National Museum of Modern Art, Osaka, Japan; and Sammlung Friedrichshof in Zurndorf, Austria, Germany. His work is in numerous prominent public and private collections, including the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; and the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh.

Leila Heller Gallery presents Exemplary Bodies, which encompasses perceptions of anatomy in contemporary art, from images of the nude to interpretations of the human figure in political contexts. The body has played a fundamental role in the development of aesthetics in art history as one of the first natural forms rendered in painting and sculpture. The artists within Exemplary Bodies look to the human anatomy as civilizations have in the past, as mediums for expression and commentary on contemporary society, especially through the prominent use of the female body-as-symbolic medium.

 Examples of this include Nick Moss, who welds thick, hardened steel into the delicate physique signature to the classical nude, and Rachel Lee Hovnanian’s Body Armor, which hones in on the commercialization of femininity and womanhood. Delving further into the notion of a processed body, Marilyn Minter captures the sexualization of pop icons, such as Pamela Anderson. Anderson’s nipple just barely peeks from beyond the frame, breasts mirrored by the spherical nature of bubbles. With eyes shut and hair soaking wet, her posture suggests she is unreservedly unclothed, obscuring the discourse in the canon of western history between nakedness and nudity. Additional works featuring prominent female figures whose bodies fed the carnal desires of American society include Marilyn Monroe and Kate Moss - Marrakech, by Richard Hudson and Albert Watson, respectively.

 On the verge of frolicsome, borderline caustic, humor, Kenny Scharf provides a humorous albeit uneasy depiction of liquifying physiognomy in Sloppy Melt. This sardonic depiction of the human face is reflected once again in both the plaster bust by Bruce High Quality, painted in haphazard “makeup,” and Olympia. Sharing both imagery and namesake from Manet’s own Olympia, Bruce High Quality adapts the Impressionist masterpiece to urban tastes, inverting its colors and lining the scene in a vivid magenta neon, reflecting the breasts of Hovnanian’s plaster and resin Bimbo. Reza Aramesh is the final artist joining the ranks in Exemplary Bodies, with his polychrome sculptures featuring lime-wood and glass. Joining us following his inclusion in the Met Breuer’s exhibition Like Life: Sculpture, Color, and the Body, Aramesh renders images of suffering born from a huge archival database of press photographs spanning from the Vietnam War until today. Incorporating his work in Exemplary Bodies underscores the significance of the message within this show — to showcase the versatile nature of the human body as a medium for visual dialogue, whether in the capture of mortality, lechery, wanton, or pure, corporeal beauty.

The title of the show, Verdure, finds inspiration from the Latin word for “lush arrangements” and “fresh, natural abundance.” Just as the term denotes, works within this show encompass the employment and exploitation of themes repurposed from the environment, whether physically, as in the use of flowers and sheet metals, to the reconstitution of philosophical ideals, as exemplified by Philip Taaffe’s Averroes, who borrows his title from the namesake of the Andalusian philosopher.

 Verdure includes a survey of works by Rachel Lee Hovnanian featuring distinct representations of her signature narcissus flower. Finding inspiration in the myth of Narcissus, where a beautiful hunter withers away as he remains enthralled by his reflection, Hovnanian places narcissus petals in botox “vases,” immortalizing them in marble and reflective glass mirrors as exemplified by Le Petit and Glance, respectively. Shoja Azari and Shahram Karimi’s video paintings embody the theme of Verdure. Through a collaborative effort between both artists, Azari’s video rendering of the elements — wind, foliage, and light — provide motion to the naturalistic paintings by Karimi. Dreamscape VI depicts the abundance of summer, reflected in sunlight and foliage, as Dreamscape II portrays the early spring, when cherry blossoms are found in full bloom.

 As Verdure speaks to copiousness and bounty, the notion of collage as a cornucopia of imagery fits well within the theme of this show. Donald Baechler’s The Rose of Delhi: No. 1 features a fabric collage, providing a unique perspective into the interpretations of Eastern imagery processed by a Western gaze. In his unique, juvenile aesthetic, he recalls the historical relationship between both cultures through the trading of textile — a huge catalyst in the globalization of the world. Speaking to the palette of the natural world — of blues, golds, and greens — and its rich visual, rhythmic vocabulary, Negar Akhami’s The Water is Turbid from its Source wields Iranian culture and calligraphy to “unleash Persian art’s expressive potential, to use it as a springboard for an original personal vision.” This desire, to capture the vastness of meaning and existence, is best exemplified in the sheer width of the work, speaking to the theme of the show.

 The meticulous constitution of Akhami’s work is reflected in the set of three Ran Hwang Odes. Calling attention to the import placed in Eastern cultures on silence and calm, and the absence of this in contemporary Western society, Hwang constructs an arrangement of plexiglass, pins, and paper buttons emulating texture found across oil painting. By doing so, she fabricates ethereal windows into what has become the fantasy of silence in a world brimming with noise.

 Ultimately, the works in Verdure recall an adolescent Earth — an environment composed of untamed wildlife and uncultivated ideas. When faced with the exigences of the unknown, history illustrates a pattern of humans looking to nature for answers, whether in light of a need for nutritional sustenance, as detailed in Michael Pollan’s book ‘The Botany of Desire,’ or academic necessity. In reflecting on this instinctive behavior, the artists of Verdure follow this pattern, looking to their own environments, producing their perspectives in visual mediums, and, in doing so, effectively locating a solution.

Nadège Desgenétez’s work references the body, familiar landscapes and the process of glass blowing. She says that glass blowing is ‘at once physical and mental and requires a commitment to the present, a keen awareness of the body’s boundaries and abilities and of the specific needs of the molten glass. The material is shaped by touch, with breath, answering every move, in a sequence that cannot be interrupted or postponed. Objects made of hand blown glass embody the process through which they are made.’

 Born in France, Desgenétez has worked, taught and exhibited in Europe, North America, Asia and Australia. She has been the recipient of numerous awards and residencies, including the “Prix d’Honneur de la Fondation de France” (Paris, France), and two Saxe Awards from Pilchuck Glass School in 1997 and 2004 (Stanwood, USA). Her work is included in the collections of the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA; Canberra Museum and Art Gallery, Canberra, Australia, Museum of Glass, Tacoma, WA and the China Academy of Art, Hangzhou, China. She has been teaching at the Glass Workshop of the Australian National University in Canberra since 2005.

Bidstrup’s work explores optical phenomena and interprets utopic social and architectural ideas through glass sculpture, installation and video. Her curiosity revolves around the power of perception, context and point of view in constructing our understanding through vision and how the human eye and mind are always engaged in myriad determinations and negotiations.

 Bidstrup studied at the Rhode Island School of Design and has taught at her alma mater, the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Art, School of Design on Bornholm since 2009. She was a visiting lecturer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2015. Bidstrup has exhibited internationally for the past decade. She is the co-founder of The Copenhagen-based collaborative Luftkraft Glass Studio.

<![CDATA[
“I have seen the future and it is now and it is China. There is no need for the past. It can be erased. A new happiness is being constructed, an approximation of joy, better than the real thing.”

 - Christopher Anderson -


 Danziger Gallery opens its fall season with the first American solo show of photographs by Christopher Anderson. Born in Canada in 1970, Anderson grew up in the West Texas town of Abilene before roaming the world and finally settling in Barcelona. He first gained recognition for his photography in 1999 when his images of the rescue of Haitian boat refugees won him the Robert Capa Gold Medal. In 2005 he joined the renowned Magnum collective where he has proved to be one of its bright stars.

 Anderson’s photographs of metropolitan men and women on the streets of Shanghai and Shenzhen, China taken over the last two years picture a world that is largely unknown to most Westerners. Shenzhen, China’s Silicon Valley, barely existed thirty years ago but today has some twenty million inhabitants. Shanghai, China’s biggest city, has a population of over 24 million. Between the smog and constant development a grey/blue light hangs over both these cities providing an almost surreal or theatrical illumination to Anderson’s portraits. Whatever our preconceptions, Anderson presents an up to date image of the reality that is modern urban China.

 Working almost invisibly, and focusing in on tight close-ups that exclude all context except the unusual light on the faces of his subjects, what first struck Anderson was that people around the world have begun to look and act the same. Yet in the face of this observation he felt compelled to wonder “Who are these individual people? What do they dream about? What truth do these pictures convey?”

 Mysterious, sensual, and visceral, Anderson’s China pictures are a noteworthy addition to the photographic tradition of Walker Evans and Harry Callahan that captures people unaware of being photographed while seeking a psychological truth in the faces and expressions of its subjects. Like Walker Evans, Anderson’s pictures were taken when “the guard is down and the mask is off”. Yet Anderson’s photographs could not have been made without the recent technological developments of digital cameras and lenses that allowed him to not only make color pictures in the ambient night light (when most of them were taken) but also to record the subtlest details and shades of color.

 As with his notable predecessors, Anderson’s exploration of the human condition takes place within a rigid conceptual framework, separating his subjects from their background and focusing on their faces and expressions. As Sarah Greenough observed writing about Harry Callahan’s “Women Lost in Thought” series: “His refusal to project any kind of narrative or literary interpretation, his respect for his subjects, and his recognition of their need for privacy and reflection in a crowded city also elicits a sense of empathy and kinship. He was at once removed and detached, a dispassionate observer of this modern spectacle, and also one of them.”

 In a medium that is so often a complicit one, there is a both a beauty and a shock to seeing people’s outer details so nakedly exposed. Anderson’s photographs record the surface while posing unanswered questions about his subjects’ inner lives.

 The book “Approximate Joy” is published by Stanley/Barker and will be released on September 4th.

<![CDATA[
To start off the fall season, George Adams Gallery will present a survey of paintings and drawings by Luis Cruz Azaceta dating from 1984-89, arguably some of the artist’s most forceful imagery. In the mid-‘80s Azaceta developed a raw, expressionist style of painting on a huge scale, to depict th
]]>

e anguish and fear he observed around him. With himself as an avatar of this suffering, he touched on issues which continue to resonate today, such as repression of individual freedoms, isolation of the self as a result of dislocation, the scourge of AIDS and unchecked violence.

 Born in Cuba, Azaceta immigrated to the states following the revolution at the age of 18. He went on to receive his degree from SVA and came to prominence in the late-‘70s with a series of grotesque and bitterly satirical paintings that captured the New York of the time. However, it was the many self-portraits he experimented with over the next decade which lead him to a more visceral, personal expression in his paintings. In the mid-‘80s, Azaceta began using a fluid painting technique, dripping paint directly onto large canvases laid on the floor to, in his words, “create utter chaos… until a cacophonous texture was achieved.” From this ground would emerge a single figure, its limbs truncated or emaciated and an expression of horror or pain on its face. Azaceta has identified fear as a central preoccupation while mortality and humanistic concerns characterize his work as a whole. Specifically, it was the sense of displacement Azaceta identified as a product of his own exiled status, by which he seeks to reveal the pain felt by any person living as an outsider. The painting ‘Untitled (Self-portrait)’ 1987 shows the artist stick-like and laid out as if in death, bisecting the enormous 10x12 ft canvas, radiating concentric bands of muddy color. This same composition would inform his ‘AIDS Count’ series which followed.

 In 1987, in response to the growing crisis of AIDS, Azaceta began making paintings directly addressing the senseless loss of the epidemic. Over the next few years, he completed several paintings and works on paper addressing the disease - bleakly illustrating the toll in human lives through piles of skulls, ticking clocks and an endless count of the afflicted. As one of the earliest artists to directly address AIDS in his work, Azaceta used the humanistic and sympathetic approach embodied in his paintings for the AIDS series. Where often his figures are self-portraits, by equating himself with the role of victim, his message becomes one of compassion.

 Luis Cruz Azaceta was born in Havana, Cuba in 1942. He received his BFA from the School of Visual Arts in 1969. His work has been widely exhibited both nationally and internationally and is featured in major public collections such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; and Museo de Arte Contemporaneo, Monterrey, Mexico, among others. The subject of multiple lifetime retrospectives, Azaceta is also the recipient of numerous major grants from the Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts among others.

<![CDATA[
[My painting] represents an oneiric reality in which man is besieged by a number of forces that surround him: eroticism, mechanical civilization, the elements of war, as well as other afflicting impositions. A metaphor of belts, pieces of armory or machinery, binding strings, cutting knives, and violent actions that plague the body and mind …

 Leon Tovar is pleased to announce the opening of Agustín Fernández: Hole in the Wall, the Cuban artist’s debut exhibition with the Gallery. Taking as its starting point the year 1972—the date of Fernández’s move to New York City—the Gallery will display selections of his technically exemplary paintings, drawings, and collages. From the often monumental oils—with their foreboding juxtapositions of soft flesh and sharply contoured metal—to the delicately rendered and sparse works on paper, Fernández’s work confronts the conditions of exile while offering meditations on the erotic and the metaphysical. Surrealist tropes are appropriated and reapplied to present psychologically charged and dramatic tableaux in which seemingly opposite forms and terms coexist in tension—penetration becomes extrusion; the breast the phallus; the razor blade the serpent’s scale.
 Living in New York since 1972, the artist was introduced to the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe in 1979, sparking a friendship that lasted until the latter’s premature death in 1989. Despite a shared erotic vocabulary, Fernández would draw a line between himself and the photographer, reflecting that “…his profession and mine have nothing in common, and my aims and aspirations don’t correspond to his…” Nevertheless, a forthright examination of eroticism and sexuality, pleasure and pain, steps out from the shadows in the work of both artists. Describing Mapplethorpe’s famous Self Portrait with Whip, Fernández stated that Mapplethorpe “oblige[s] us to share in an act that should be intimate, private—in this case forbidden; to see something that may disgust us, which we are forced to witness.” This forced-looking is likewise characteristic of the Cuban’s artwork in which tightly framed and cropped compositions focus our vision on the realms of the lower body. Placed in the immediate foreground, ambiguous and mutable forms push forward from the picture plane, appearing at times more sculptural relief than painting. They occupy a shallow pictorial space that the artist likens to a “background wall,” a comparison that gives rise to the title of the exhibition.

 The motif of the “hole in the wall” operates not only as a literal description of the artist’s often centripetally oriented canvases; it also calls attention to the transgressive nature of the paintings and drawings themselves. Paintings like Untitled (1983) and the monumental Oculus (1990) treat the pictorial surface as a wall in and of itself, breached and ruptured, disclosing recognizable though uncanny forms. Agustín Fernández: Hole in the Wall brings together two decades of the artist’s paintings, drawings, and collages, an accumulation of furtive glances stolen from behind the wall of normative representation, where forms engage in restless Surrealist reversals and viewers are kept in a position of unknowing.

 Agustín Fernández was born in Havana, Cuba in 1928. Upon receipt of a government-funded scholarship in 1959, Fernández left his home country for France where he exhibited at the Galerie Fürstenberg, a focal point for the Paris-based Surrealists. During this time, a somber, cold palette began to replace the vividly colored canvases that characterized his earlier paintings, which had already begun to explore a vocabulary of biomorphic abstraction. This newfound muted and dark tonality would remain a constant in his work, while evocations of the body—represented in fleshy folds, protrusions, and in pieces—would feature regularly as sites of desire and confrontation. In 1968, the artist left for Puerto Rico, where he lived until he moved to New York in 1972. Fernández continued to work until his death in 2006, and his art is held in the collections of such prestigious institutions as the Brooklyn Museum of Art (Brooklyn, NY); El Museo del Barrio (New York, NY); Jack S. Blanton Museum of Art (University of Texas, Austin); Museum of Modern Art (New York, NY); Victoria and Albert Museum (London, UK); and the Yale University Art Gallery (New Haven, CT).

<![CDATA[
Senior &amp; Shopmaker presents Spheres of Influence: Al Held, Michael Craig-Martin, Judy Pfaff, and Stanley Whitney, a group exhibition of drawings by preeminent abstract painter and former Yale professor, Al Held (1928-2005), along with three illustrious former students from the Yale School of Art graduate program in the 1960s and 70s. Michael Craig-Martin (MFA 1966); Judy Pfaff (MFA 1973); and Stanley Whitney (MFA 1972) have each acknowledged the impact Held had on the development of their critical thinking and practice during their student years and beyond. This exhibition brings together works on paper by each artist, suggesting overlapping spheres of influence rather than linear attributions. Within the works on view, which date from 1963 to 2018, common themes emerge: the depiction of volumetric space, underlying or overt geometry, and the use of color as a structural element.

 Yale University’s art department in the early 1960s emphasized a pluralist approach, featuring teachers with wide-ranging practices who encouraged students to master different techniques, media, and styles. Following the transformational teaching methodologies Josef Albers established during his tenure as chairman of the department (1950-58), Jack Tworkov, Albers’ successor from 1963-69, continued to innovate by inviting artists active in the New York art scene to teach at the school. At Tworkov’s invitation, Al Held, like Albers a hard-edged abstract painter, joined the graduate faculty in 1963 as Visiting Critic, and assumed the title of Associate Professor in 1966, and Adjunct Professor of Art in 1970. Held was a role model, representing to his students the successful professional engagement possible for a working artist. He was to continue teaching at Yale until 1980, later revealing in an interview teaching’s impact on his own work: “… every year there are two or three or four kids who you begin to believe in, you develop a relationship with and because of that kind of credibility and believability from you to them they force you to see things that you wouldn’t have looked at very seriously by yourself.” The dialogue between teacher and student was a dynamic and multi-directional one.



 Michael Craig-Martin (b. 1941 Dublin, Ireland) grew up in the United States, and received both his B.A. (1963), as well as his M.F.A. (1966) from Yale. In the mid-1960s, he returned to Europe, becoming one of the key figures in the first generation of British conceptual artists. Through exacting draftsmanship, Craig-Martin uses composition to explore spatial relationships between disparate objects from contemporary life. “I’m essentially a constructor, a putter-togetherer of things. I see my paintings as being informed by my years of making sculpture. I think of my paintings as flat sculptures.”

 Judy Pfaff (b. 1946, London. England) immigrated to the United States when she was thirteen; she received her BFA at Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, and her MFA from Yale in 1973. A pioneer of installation art in the 1970s, Pfaff continues to synthesize sculpture and painting into dynamic, architectural environments in which the perception of space fluctuates between the two- and three-dimensional. The illusion of space is a binding characteristic between Pfaff’s early and current work, as is her use of bright and receding color as a spatial tool. Included in the exhibition is a selection of multicolored tape drawings on graph paper titled Drawings for Prototypes, which relate to Pfaff’s spare stick figure sculptures of the late 1970s and early 1980s.

 Stanley Whitney (b. 1946, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) holds a BFA from Kansas City Art Institute, Kansas City, Missouri and received his MFA from Yale University in 1972. Following time spent in Italy and then later in Egypt in the mid-1990s, Whitney developed an architectural approach to abstraction that has become his signature style. In his watercolors, rectangles of vivid, solid colors are arranged in deliberately irregular grids. In contrast, in Whitney’s graphite drawings space is compressed with energetic and improvisational line and mark-making.

 Al Held (b. 1928, Brooklyn, NY- d. 2005, Todi, Italy) is considered a prominent figure among second-generation Abstract Expressionists, but his persistent exploration of illusionistic potential within abstraction defied many of the labels of post–Abstract Expressionist movements. In the early 1960s, Held’s paintings underwent an evolution away from expressionism towards the sharpened contours, geometric forms, and gradually enlarged scale associated with Hard Edge painting. Held, however, was steadfast in his rejection of critic Clement Greenberg’s modernist doctrine and its insistence on pure flatness. In the late 1960s, tiring of reductivist aesthetics, he strove to incorporate space and volume into his canvases. His paintings of 1967–68 were exclusively black and white; subsequently, he began to explore three-dimensionality by structuring his compositions using vanishing points, culminating in the illusionistic geometric compositions and vibrant color of the late 1970s and beyond. His works on paper represent, on a more intimate scale, Held’s intent towards ordered abstraction and illusionism.

Curated by Audra Lambert

 Fountain House Gallery, representing artists living with mental illness, announces the upcoming opening of Domicile, a group show examining our relationship to interior spaces and domestic objects.

 Domicile is curated by Audra Lambert, an independent curator. Said Lambert, “It has been an honor to work with Fountain House Gallery on Domicile. It has been especially rewarding to review the fantastic collection of artworks that Fountain House community artists have set forth, as well as to include works by a range of artistic voices including artists Camille Eskell, Olivia Jane Huffman, and Maxwell McInnis. I have long admired Fountain House Gallery’s brave approach to supporting contemporary art and experimentation, and it has been gratifying to curate this incredible survey reflecting on the space that matters most to us in reality and in memory, in fact, and in the fictions we create: that ubiquitous, universal space of Home.”

 Domicile is a contemporary survey of painting, sculpture, photography and mixed-media works engaging with our intrinsic, insistent relationship to the idea of Home. Seen here through the lens of artist Alyson Vega’s mixed-media compositions and the hybridized furniture-as-art-objects of Maxwell McInnis, among others, Domicile creates a space where longing and inquiry combine. Materials evoking domestic spaces, such as fabric and wooden surfaces, combine with photographs and paintings of more traditional interior views reflecting the crucial roles that homes play in our everyday lives. The simulated and the real also share space in Domicile, where an interior tableau invites the public to re-imagine the Fountain House Gallery space as a playful intrusion of private space into the public domain.

 This program is funded, in part, by generous support from the Hearst Foundation, Inc., the Renate, Hans and Maria Hofmann Trust, the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, the David Rockefeller Fund, and the Laurie M. Tisch Illumination Fund.

Sous Les Etoiles Gallery presents “Works 1957-2005” the first survey exhibition in the United States of the Italian artist Gianfranco Chiavacci (1936-2011).

 A self-taught and innovative Tuscan artist, Gianfranco Chiavacci was born in 1936 in Pistoia, near Florence, where he lived and worked for all his life. Tirelessly inventive and driven by an insatiable curiosity, Gianfranco Chiavacci developed, over the course of his fifty-year-long career, a poetically experimental artistry that deviated from the conventional rules of creation. By intersecting the experiences of the binary language with the expression of abstract art, Chiavacci has demonstrated a pioneer vision seeking to decode this language by applying it in his paintings, photographs, drawings and sculptures.

 Chiavacci’s work has been exhibited in solo and group exhibitions since 1967. In 2015, a joint exhibition with French artist François Morellet, founding member of op-kinetic art research group G.R.A.V., was curated by Italian art galleries Artforms and Die Mauer. The title of this exhibition Chiavacci | Morellet, rigorosi, rigolards…was conceived as a dialogue between these two polymorphic artists.

d a particular sensitivity to the subtleties of language and gestures employed by archetypal, cultural figures. Her work seeks to transcend its physicality by referencing greater linguistic systems, social grids, or emotional strata.

 A Flower Is A Lovesome Thing includes Anderson’s latest video installation, centrally placed amid a selection of recent sculpture. The shared title of both the exhibition and video references Vince Guaraldi’s instrumental adaptation of a song by the same name. Set within a ‘box office window’, a nebulous entity slowly rises and hovers in darkness before dissolving into stock and educational imagery. Two synchronized voices overlap to deliver an original monologue sourced in part from the 1992 film Enchanted April and the 1935 film Bride of Frankenstein. The entity possesses a highly developed vocabulary, yet, like Frankenstein’s creature, struggles when exposed to unfamiliar or threatening cultural phenomena. The creature, a caricature of extreme suffering, has limited linguistic tools to perceive and communicate its own nuanced emotional experiences; its raw gestural reactions become its own language. Anderson’s sculptural work explores comparable themes of this emergent expression of the inability to process reality.

 A grouping of precisely arranged sculptures embody sad, sometimes funny, and familiar states of being. Trapped within their signified roles and fixed by their corporeality, Anderson’s figures characterize situational anxieties in several forms. She explores the discord present in both complex and basic human emotions, and the application of these gestures onto sculptural objects. The works include: a pair of children or Best Friends approaching a box office window beyond reach, a catalogue-inspired bride that stands alone, a second bride occupying the figurehead of a ‘boat’, two babies battling for personal space, a prototypical Sunrise comprised of stacked rolls of tape and a bottle of sunscreen, and a functional harp, constructed by the artist, that suggests the sound of a dream sequence – at once elegant and approaching irrelevancy.

 Brimming with poetic implications, Anderson’s autonomous works collectively allow for a broader reading as a single composition, inviting viewers interpretations to mutate and evolve. By carefully manipulating scale with everyday materials, she reformats viewpoints that are both indeterminate and grounded in reality, and creates improbable pairings within multiple genres.

 Sam Anderson was born in Los Angeles, CA and currently lives and works in New York, NY. In 2010 she received an MFA in sculpture from Yale University. She has had solo exhibitions at Joan, Los Angeles (2018), Sculpture Center, New York (2017, 2013), Kölnischer Kunstverein, Cologne (2017), Rowhouse Project, Baltimore (2016), Tanya Leighton, Berlin (2015), Mother’s Tankstation, Dublin (2014), and Chapter NY (2013). Her work has also been included in exhibitions at MoMA PS1, Queens (2015), Maccarone, New York (2015), White Columns, New York (2015), Night Gallery, Los Angeles (2014, 2012), and the ICA Philadelphia (2012). Anderson’s films have been included in exhibitions at Anthology Film Archives, New York (2013, 2009). Mousse Publishing published a monograph of Anderson’s work in 2017.

<![CDATA[
A knowledge of photography is just as important as that of the alphabet. The illiterates of the future will be ignorant of the use of camera and pen alike.

 -Laszlo Moholy-Nagy in 1936, as quoted in Moholy-Nagy: Future Present

 The sheer scale of this data has far exceeded human sense-making capabilities. At these scales, patterns are often too subtle and relationships too complex or multi-dimensional to observe by simply looking at the data. Data mining is a means of automating part of this process to detect interpretable patterns; it helps us see the forest without getting lost in the trees.

 -Alexander Furnas, “Everything You Wanted to Know about Data Mining but Were Afraid to Ask”, The Atlantic. April 3, 2012

 Rick Wester Fine Art presents the debut exhibition of Data Mine, an ongoing project by the photographer Cassandra Zampini that speaks to the complex contemporary tapestry that weaves and warps the personal obsessions of self-expression, self-identity and self-discovery through the use of the “selfie” in social media. In her first New York exhibition, Ms. Zampini is exhibiting seven large scale composite portraits comprised of thousands of images downloaded from Instagram, chosen from over the 2.5 million images she has so far collected. Carefully chosen and organized, the images are arranged by pose, processed to be monochromatic and then deliberately arranged in patterns that create a tonal range from near complete opaqueness to negative form, then transforming to positive images and back again. The titles are hashtags Ms. Zampini applies to describe the poses, followed by the amount of time it took to upload the images at a rate of approximately 750 new selfies per second. The vertical works are created in one size only ranging from 50 x 30 inches to nearly 90 x 50 inches. They are released in editions of only three examples each.

 Instagram has done more for people to communicate through photography than any other media since the invention of the picture press and the massive popularity of photographically illustrated magazines from the early 20thcentury through the Post-War era, the prime difference being that it is interactive, responsive and free of charge. The simple vastness of the amount of imagery Zampini has mined is staggering but the information gleaned from the pictures is far more significant and wide ranging. Zampini’s conclusions include the revelation that despite the complete freedom allowed the sitter/photographer, people tend to mimic existing poses in environments already familiar to them, no matter their geographic location or background. In an era dominated by the omnipresence of Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms, there is an urgent need for artists to explore the ramifications of such a phenomenon on our understanding of our culture and the world. Poignantly, Zampini’s categorizations of poses allows for a democratic distribution of race, gender, sexual identity and any other identifier for presenting oneself to the world, suggesting a thesis stressing a uniformity in humanity rather than one accentuating our differences. With the interconnectedness of the internet, and its ability to cross-reference and unite the world’s population, Zampini has managed to create The Family of Man for Millennials, drawing upon a global source of imagery that Edward Steichen would have never been able to fathom.

 Moholy’s quote, dated 1936, came at a time when Fascism in Europe had been established and was further on the rise with limits on freedom of the press – and expression – accompanied by misinformation, inflammatory xenophobic statements and eventually, the wholesale dismissal of the rights of individuals. In this era, social media offers the public a medium for direct and peer to peer communication. The Selfie, with its universal appeal as a claim of individuality, democratizes the internet further and as Moholy would certainly revel in, gets to the essence of photography as language. Anyone, anywhere, understands this idiom now. There is nothing elitist left in self display.

Galerie Lelong &amp; Co. presents Having Gone I Will Return, a solo exhibition of new and recent work by Petah Coyne. In her first solo exhibition in New York in nearly a decade, Coyne conceives ambitious tableaux that evoke cross-cultural themes of vanity, grief, and tragedy. Her richly layered, deeply psychological sculptures evince a long-standing interest in literature and literary figures, from Bruno Schulz to Joan Didion, and Japanese literature and film in particular.

<![CDATA[
Gladstone 64 presents an exhibition of new works by Banks Violette. The artist, known for conjoining the materials and forms of Minimal and Conceptual Art with signifiers of sub-cultural communities, presents a new sculpture and a body of works on paper. Violette’s first solo presentation in New York in nearly a decade demonstrates his continued exploration of the residues left by social rupture when venerated canonical imagery is sacrificed for the sake of the new.

 For this exhibition, Violette presents a group of new drawings that examine the self-cannibalizing tendencies of contemporary America’s collective hunger to witness the rise and fall of public figures. Employing the iconography of scandals both public and private, the logo from Roseanne and a sympathetic portrait of Stormy Daniels index the fluctuating distance between the person and the persona. Seeing the exsanguination of identity and the subsequent devastation of authenticity as a metaphor for art’s impulse to replicate existing figures and forms, Violette addresses the losses inherent in all instances of facsimile. He asserts that the copy nonetheless carries the historical burden of the original and that all duplicates are permanently bound to their referents despite cultural amnesia. A graphically simple linear abstraction initially presents itself as an exercise in the syntax of Minimalism, yet gains additional emotional heft as a digital trace left on the artist’s computer by an assistant who subsequently committed suicide. Utilizing imagery that references the facility with which we reassign meaning, Violette channels the overwhelming desire for the loss of the real and the continual production of myth.

 Further evincing the artist’s handling of “the copy” is a sculptural recreation of Peter Saville’s cover for New Order’s 1983 album, Power Corruption and Lies, itself a repurposing of Henri Fantin-Latour’s 1890 painting, Roses in a Basket. An appropriation of an appropriation, Violette’s iteration is composed of a basket cast via the lost-wax method and a living replica of the floral arrangement depicted in the still life. Rather than aiming for a three-dimensional transposition of a two-dimensional canvas, though, the artist instead revels in the ersatz quality of his replica, a gesture made explicit in the decision to include only white flowers. Thwarting the viewer’s desire to encounter the object as a manifestation of the painting’s original subject, Violette instead presents it to us as a post-mortem artifact, a signifier so bloated with oscillating connotation that it wilts under the weight of its own history.

 Banks Violette was born in 1973 and lives and works in Ithaca, New York. He received his B.F.A. from the School of Visual Arts, New York and his M.F.A. from Columbia University, New York. His work has been the subject of numerous solo exhibitions, including those at Museum Dhont-Dhaenens in Deurle, Belgium; Kunsthalle Wien; the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Texas; Kunsthalle Bergen, Norway; and the Whitney Museum of American Art. He has also participated in group exhibitions at The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; the Migros Museum für Gegenwartskunst, Zürich; Museum of Modern Art, New York; Palais de Tokyo, Paris; the Royal Academy, London; MoMA P.S. 1, New York; the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen, Rotterdam; among others.

Simone Subal Gallery presents the opening of Florian Meisenberg’s “In Flames Leaving Las Vegas”. This is Meisenberg’s third solo show at the gallery.

 For the past several years, Florian Meisenberg’s practice has engaged the various permutations of mediums, whether the canvas of a painting or the screen of a digital device. In these complex projects, the oil that coalesced the pigment in oil paint and the code that powered the various software experiments were functionally and theoretically the same. Distinctions between the analogue and the digital were effectively elided, opening a number of considerations about how knowledge is both disseminated and received.

 Meisenberg’s latest show “In Flames Leaving Las Vegas” initiates new creative grounds. If his previous projects exerted an external pressure, his latest paintings, sculptures, and videos delve deep inside the mind: contemplation and dreams, states of psychosis and moments of lucidity. Meisenberg has in the past transgressed the various permutations of mediums, now it’s the movement between the imagined and the real, the ideal and the material, the ways these diametrically opposed states imbricate the other.

 “In Flames Leaving Las Vegas” is a show of amorphous irrationalities, one in which the different states continually reference one another. The larger walls of the gallery are covered in wallpaper—the printed image is familiarly allusive and its form suggests a kind of circuitry. Placed atop of this surface is an arrangement of paintings of various sizes. The compositions are housed in large, brushed aluminum panels of varying shapes and dimensions and are distinct objects themselves. Incised on the panels is a line that rises and falls, turning back upon itself. It resembles the moment a flame is just about to burst into something larger. A sense of movement and an unfolding landscape is also apparent; the gesture evokes physical and narrative associations. Its flow is punctuated by either the paintings, which are flush with the frames’ surface, or the engraved word “text,” which is a placeholder for thoughts, especially those of the viewer. The paintings reflect Meisenberg’s effort to embrace and follow intuitive impulses. They represent inner states: the various conflations of thoughts, the often unsettled and contradictory life of dreams. The depictions are gestural and filled with signifying chains and allusions. Certain figures and motifs appear several times like in a recurring dream or a state of compulsive thinking. What cannot be missed is the tremendous energy each composition possesses.

 The multivalent narrative evoked in the arrangement of paintings and forms is given an added degree of complexity from the two sculptures at adjacent ends of the space. Both pieces feature a sheet of Plexiglas fashioned into the shape of cat—it’s bodily image printed onto the surface. They rest a top a plinth that conjures thoughts of geologic stratification submerged in a viscous liquid. These island like structures are like diving boards into another mental territory. The cat’s faces have been left blank, and filling the void is a projection of Nicholas Cage’s visage, which has been animated digitally to transform a found dialogue into an unsettling, murmured soliloquy. Viewers can listen to the conversation on wireless headphones, moving about the space in their own time. The disquieting sense one gets upon experiencing the films infuses the paintings and their own internal juxtapositions with an ever more nuanced understanding of how the boundaries between the mind and the world is porous and arbitrary.

<![CDATA[
Somewhere beyond the scorched gable end and the burnt-out buses
 there is a poet indulging
 his wretched rage for order –
 or not as the case may be; for his
 is a dying art,
 an eddy of semantic scruples
 in an unstructurable sea.
 —Derek Mahon

 Josée Bienvenu presents Whatever You Say Say Nothing, Stefana McClure’s fifth solo exhibition with the gallery. Taken from a poem by Seamus Heaney, the title originates with the secretive activity of Northern Ireland’s rebel paramilitary that admonished its members with this demand.

 The exhibition navigates the relationship between art and politics, interrogating the nature of artistic responsibility, the clash and blend of different traditions, the endless interaction, for better or worse, of past and present, the dangerous undercurrents of injustice and resentment, complacency and discontent, while also pointing to memory as mutable, prone to the passage of time and the vagaries of the imagination.

 Explosions were everyday events in the Belfast of the early 1970s where McClure grew up and they figure largely in a series of new Teflon drawings. Taking the form of open notebooks, each is a rendering of a protest poem “typed” on a sensitive Teflon surface by typists and stenographers wearing special gloves that have been modified to bear an IBM Selectric golfball at the end of each finger. Rich with imagery of drums, bombs, banners and sectarian graffiti, as Heaney put it, these poems strive to “grant the religious intensity of the violence its deplorable authenticity and complexity.”

 Eight small jackets (the size worn by first grade elementary school students) are hung low on pegs, their pockets groaning under the weight of the hefty poetry-wrapped stones that they accommodate. Often displaying a reckless courage, children from Catholic ghettos grew up throwing stones at police vans and army vehicles, taunting soldiers as they hauled off fathers and brothers in dawn raids. The text of a single “troubles” poem is divided between the two stones, one for each pocket, ready to be thrown. The words of the poems gain literal weight and even the anticipation of action and violence from their supports.

 Hand-knit reconstructions of vintage Snakes and Ladders boards, presented both on the wall and on a shelf, are a reminder that, born in another place or at another time, some of those same six-year-olds might have engaged in more innocent forms of play.

 Deconstructed and reconfigured as a continuous ball of string, The Fortress of Solitude by Jonathan Lethem stands as a single sculpture, a complete world unto itself. The shape-shifting demons of racism haunting Brooklyn in the 1970s have an obvious parallel in the themes of sectarian division and intransigence, the fear, suspicion and violence that Irish children are heir to. Translating, transposing, and decoding the synesthetic structure connecting text and image, McClure unveils the layers of embedded information to which we are constantly subjected and brings to light the complexities and the aftermath of violence on societies.

 Born in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, Stefana McClure lives and works in New York. She has exhibited extensively at museums and galleries internationally. McClure’s work was recently exhibited in White Covers-Private Choices, curated by Carine Fol, at CENTRALE for Contemporary Art in Brussels. In 2017, she was a Frank Williams Visiting Artist at Wellesley College, MA. Select exhibitions include: Die Frick Kollektion: works from the Kunstsammlung Mezzanin, Liechtenstein, curated by Arno Egger, Kunst Palais Liechtenstein, Feldkirch, Austria (2017); Deep Cuts: Contemporary Paper Cutting, curated by Samantha Cataldo, Currier Museum of Art, Manchester, NH (2017); The Times, The Flag Art Foundation, New York, NY (2017); What’s Yours is Mine, Bartha Contemporary, London, UK (2017); Format: 35 Jahre Sammlung Schroth, curated by Juliane Rogge, Museum Wilhelm Morgner, Soest, DE (2017); The Siege of the Flying Mermaids, Josée Bienvenu Gallery, New York (2015); Possible Side Effects, Arróniz Arte Contemporanéo, Mexico City, MX (2015); and Terrible Beauty: Art, Crisis, Change &amp; The Office of Non-Compliance, Dublin Contemporary Biennial, IE (2011).

<![CDATA[
J.B. (John Bunion) Murray was born in 1908 in Glascock County, Georgia. In the history of African American non-mainstream artists Murray falls into the second generation, born after the 19th century and before 1950.

 His important graphic abstractions come from a unique place in the annals of this art. His generation dealt with a harsh variation of survival for black Americans in the South. Many of the problems of that time, like Jim Crow laws that were not struck from the books until 1965, continued into the present despite institutional and popular denial. It was an era of poverty and racism exacerbated by the disillusionment of black Americans who fought as victorious heroes in the World Wars only to return to the same ugly visage of the Jim Crow years as when they left.

 The church attended by black Americans at that time was not the same as the white church. Black Pentecostalists were possessed by the Holy Spirit and moved in ways closer to the Old Religion than to the mainstream church. The banning of drums in the 19th century had moved rhythms into the body itself as manifested in the ring shouts, expressed by clapping, tambourines, cymbals, guitars and the rhythmic breaking up of language.

 J.B. Murray was always spiritual. He was a church-going Pentecostalist who ultimately became more and more involved in a cosmic battle between good and evil. He believed some people were saved and some were not, and the battle to save those who were tormented by evil became the subject of his Spirit-inspired drawings.

 His beliefs were too radical even for the local parishioners. He was asked to leave his community church. Soon after he was institutionalized because of his fervid praying and blessing, but was released within a short period of time having been diagnosed not insane. Now validated, he was allowed back in church again, even delivering a sermon or two. Illiterate, he handed out scraps of paper covered in his spirit writing given to him by an ecstatic experience that changed his life forever. In the late 1970’s he received this vision in his garden while hosing his plants, in a flood of buttery yellow and rainbow light refracted by the waters that coated the world around him and covered his skin in gold. He looked up and saw a visionary eagle cross the hot yellow sun. Clearly the intensity of these colors was an integral part of his vision and subsequent art making.

 Events led to his being given access to better artistic materials than he could find previously. He developed a unique style in which, through color and line, he drew the intense language given to him by the Spirit, which he read by looking through a bottle of well water. On paper and board he fought the battle for the Soul of Man. He drew with both hands. His process was not only the mechanical act of drawing, he fought for the salvation of souls with each mark . The drawings are living records of this visionary struggle. The natural abstraction comes from Murray’s burning need to communicate a moral standing in his own cohesive language. Murray died in 1988.

 His work is in major museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Harlem Studio Museum, the Smithsonian Museum of American Art, the High Museum of Art, The Menil Collection, and the American Folk Art Museum.

 Cavin-Morris Gallery represents the family estate with these rich dynamic evocations of man’s ancient spirit. Our exhibition will present three phases of Murray’s work, including three early pieces on cash register scroll.

Curated by Carrie Moyer and Sarah Watson with Agnes Gund Curatorial Fellows
 Evan Bellantone and Sophia Ma and Hunter MA and MFA students enrolled in the
 Advanced Curatorial Certificate

 Stephen Mueller: Orchidaceous presents a rare look into the late painter’s oeuvre during a period of rigorous creative transformation. The exhibition traces Mueller’s formal and conceptual evolution from his high-octane, impetuous gestural work from the late 1980s to the spatial complexity, exquisite color and sensuous facture of his late paintings. With over 40 paintings and works on paper, this will be the artist’s most comprehensive exhibition to date.

 Stephen Mueller (1947–2011) was part of a loose-knit group of New York-based artists—including Mary Heilmann, Jonathan Lasker, Elizabeth Murray, Thomas Nozkowski, David Reed, Pat Steir, Gary Stephan and others—who transformed and reenergized American abstract painting during the late 1970s and 1980s. Building on the tenets of Color Field painting, Mueller’s subtle, luminous images anticipate many of the concerns of contemporary painting. The work overflows with visual puns and associations through sophisticated re-combinations of Asian iconography, cartoons, encyclopedic decorative traditions, new-age sensibility, and electric, synthetic color. Through his endlessly innovative use of acrylic paint, his canvases become portals into radiant space. The trajectory of Mueller’s work reveals an artist deeply committed to inventing his own articulation of the spiritual—an impulse that has particular appeal and resonance for painters working today.

 Stephen Mueller: Orchidaceous is the result of generous collaboration with the Estate of Stephen Mueller; Texas Gallery, Houston; and Lennon, Weinberg, Inc., New York. The exhibition is accompanied by a richly illustrated publication containing an essay by curator Carrie Moyer; Mueller’s own writing; and interviews with painters in Mueller’s creative circle, including Robin Bruch, Joe Fyfe, Judith Hudson, Shirley Kaneda, Melissa Meyer, Carl Palazzolo, Ellen Phelan, Pat Steir and Billy Sullivan. A full schedule of public programing will accompany the exhibition.

 Stephen Mueller had nearly 50 solo exhibitions during his lifetime. His paintings were included in numerous group exhibitions across the U.S., Europe, and Asia, including in two Whitney Biennials (1987, 1995). Curated by Klaus Kertess, Mueller’s 2003 mid-career exhibition was held at the Joslyn Museum, Omaha, NE. He was the recipient of grants and fellowships from the NEA, NYFA, the Gottlieb Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation and the Pollock-Krasner Foundations, among others. Between 2003 and 2011, Mueller was a frequent contributor for artcritical.com, Gay City News, and Art in America. His work is held in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the High Museum, Atlanta; the Brooklyn Museum; the Birmingham Museum of Art; and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, among others. His estate is jointly represented by Texas Gallery, Houston; and Lennon, Weinberg, Inc., New York.

Curated by James Cavello

 WESTWOOD GALLERY NYC presents a solo exhibition of paintings, sculptures, and photomontages by New York artist, Will Insley (1929-2011), curated by James Cavello. During his lifelong career as an artist, Insley utilized his architectural knowledge of space, structure, and purpose to visualize and create ONECITY, an abstract, mythological civilization. For 50 years he developed ONECITY through writing, poetry, calculations, drawings, paintings, photomontage and sculptural models.

 ONECITY is a 675 mile square labyrinthine structure located in the middle of the United States, intended to house 400 million Americans. The paintings on view represent wall fragments uncovered from the vaults of the Opaque Library, the seed and soul of ONECITY. The converging lines on the paintings muse over ratio numerations of order and disorder, a reflection of the overall visual complexity of ONECITY. Insley’s mathematical and mythical construction extends to outer lying abstract /buildings/ representing lessons in abstract architectural form. The abstract /buildings/ are on exhibit as architectural sculptural models, as well as illustrative photomontages from the 1970’s. The lower level gallery focuses on the vintage photomontages and their context in the development of ONECITY.

 The mind has an architectural structure of its own and
 I have come to know it as the Interior Building – Will Insley, 1977

Curated by Sukanya Rajaratnam

 Mnuchin Gallery presents Ed Clark: A Survey. This will be the first overview of Clark’s career in New York since the Studio Museum in Harlem’s retrospective in 1980. The exhibition will include paintings and works on paper spanning six decades, from 1962 through 2013.

 Affiliated with Abstract Expressionism, Ed Clark has continued to reinvent his unique abstract language over a sixty-year career. He is credited with being the first artist to exhibit a shaped canvas in the United States in 1957, a landmark innovation that profoundly expanded the possibilities of contemporary painting. He is also recognized for his signature process of creating paintings on the floor using a push broom, a radical gesture that transforms a humble symbol of menial labor into a tool of pure abstraction and high art. With these singular achievements, Clark established himself as a pioneer of abstract painting during a period when African-American artists were expected by many to create figurative work.

 Born in New Orleans in 1926 and raised in Chicago after 1933, Clark went on to study at the Art Institute of Chicago (1947-51) and L’Academie de la Grande Chaumiere in Paris (1952). Clark continued to live and work in Paris after the Academy, working alongside fellow ex-pat artists such as Sam Francis and Joan Mitchell. It was there that he delved permanently into abstraction, creating his first mature body of work; he explains that during this period, “I began to believe, from my conversations with other artists, that the real truth is in the stroke. For me, it is large, bold strokes that do not refer distinctly to seen nature. The paint is the subject. The motions of the strokes give the work life.” He has cited Paul Cézanne, Willem de Kooning, and, above all, Nicolas de Staël, as his greatest influences. In 1956, seeking a method of creating powerful, swiftly executed broad strokes, he developed his signature style of painting with a broom on a canvas laid horizontal on the floor, introducing a dimension of physicality and spontaneity to his process. Clark would continue experimenting with this method for the rest of his career to new effects, trading in his traditional broom for a short-handled push broom shortly thereafter, and at times also employing rollers, rags, and his own hands to apply paint and dry pigment to his canvases.

 Upon relocating to New York in 1957, Clark became a charter member of the Brata Gallery, one of a number of artist cooperative galleries on East 10th Street. Later that year, he exhibited there a shaped canvas, which has been widely documented as being the first shaped painting exhibited in the United States. A similar shaped canvas from that period, Untitled, 1957, is now in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.

 After nine years in New York, Clark returned to France, where he spent time working in Paris as well as in Vétheuil, at Joan Mitchell’s country home. It was there, in 1968, that he inaugurated his series of oval paintings. The oval motif-both as a shaped painting and as an elliptical composition on a rectangular ground-would dominate his work for the next ten years. He has explained: “I began to feel something was wrong. Our eyes don’t see in rectangles. I was interested in an expanding image, and the best way to expand an image is the oval or ellipse. It seemed to me that the oval as a natural shape could best express movement extended beyond the limits of the canvas.” Clark’s first oval painting, The Big Egg, 1968, was acquired by the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in 2013.

 In 1971, Clark visited the summer home of fellow artist Jack Whitten in Crete. Noting the profound effect of a new light and landscape on his palette and imagery, Clark went on to travel the world over the following decades, seeking to capture the energy and atmosphere of different locales. From 1980 through 2015, he spent winters in New York and summers in Paris, while taking working trips to Ife, Nigeria; Yucatan, Mexico; Bahia, Brazil; Brittany, France; and Morocco, among other destinations.

 Clark’s works are in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York; and the Detroit Institute of the Arts, among other institutions. His paintings can currently be seen in the traveling exhibition, Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power, on view at the Brooklyn Museum from September 13 through February 3, 2019, and in The Long Run, on view at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, from November 11, 2017 through November 4, 2018.

Field Projects presents Emilie Stark-Menneg’s solo exhibition, SUSPECTS, curated by Jacob Rhodes.

 Emilie Stark-Menneg’s gifted economic aesthetics are offset by the sensuality of her opulent colors and wry imagery. Combining airbrush and hard-edge, Stark-Menneg’s postdigital painting techniques toy with viewers’ expectations, subverting assumed focal points the image emerges as a mirage within a pixelated ether.

 Figures lyrically bleed into the environment even as the succulent ground encroaches upon them— a symbiotic relationship wherein hierarchies are confused and defused. Commanding humor and wit, Stark-Menneg grapples with contemporary feminine identity, the parasitic nature of painting history, and the rot of popular culture— weaving in family lore, Chagall’s animal mysticism, Hitchcock’s foreboding, and Fellini’s restlessness, to forge her own unique identity and utopic myths through these hallucinatory visions.

 Emilie Stark-Menneg (b. 1984) is an interdisciplinary artist, working in painting, video and sculpture. In 2007, she received a BFA in combined media from Cornell University, and is currently an MFA candidate in painting at RISD. Stark-Menneg has had solo exhibitions at Allouche Gallery, NYC, the Nesto Gallery of Milton Academy, Milton, MA, Elizabeth Moss Gallery, Falmouth, ME, Makebish Gallery, NYC,Kijidome, Boston, MA, Leonard R. Craig Gallery, Unity College, Unity, ME, and the Coleman Burke Gallery, Brunswick, ME. Her installation, “When We Land” was included in the 2015 Portland Museum of Art Biennial. This year Stark-Menneg will be collaborating with the poet Lyrae Van Clief-Stefanon on a performance for the Cornell Council for the Arts Biennial. And in 2019 she will be exhibiting in the DeCordova Museum’s 2019 Biennial.





 Katherine Bradford on Emilie Stark-Menneg’s Exhibition

 “Emilie’s soft focus hard focus paintings seduce us with gorgeous lime green and fuchsia people acting strangely. What are we to make of the row of navy blue women (one has lost her hand to gravity) who stare at us while we look at their backs? I think they are wanting to get through the hole in the ceiling or are they under the floor?
 I especially like the blue sisters lined up in matching red striped bathing suits.
 Here the artist gives us the feeling of a bright summer day under an even bluer sky. I’m glad the cloud has been x’ed out or I’d think this group had it too easy. There’s also an x-ray mouth filled with teeth of course but also ants, popcorn and candy. Thanks for filling us up with your wondrous world Emilie Stark- Menneg. You’ve given us a sinister beauty that comes from one of the biggest hearts full of whimsy I know. Don’t stop now.” –K.B. 2018

Arts + Leisure presents Field Days, an exhibition of new work by Zach Seeger and Amie Cunat. Cunat’s paintings feature biomorphic forms and abstractions of natural subjects, while Seeger presents a group of paintings of houses and domestic interiors, along with carved wood sculptures. Both artists turn an incisive eye towards considerations of perception and relationships of color and line, filtered through their unique approaches to painting. In addition to presenting their own work, the two artists produced a collaborative painted environment at the Arts+Leisure space, utilizing architectural elements including polychromed baseboards, moldings, trim, and a doorframe.

 Simultaneously recalling the work of Surrealist and Color Field painters, Cunat’s paintings bear an enigmatic presence. Her use of compositional cues drawn from the natural world (particularly evident in her abstraction of a sunflower) along with her penchant for sophisticated and unpredictable color harmonies infuses her work with a subtle tension of familiarity and otherworldliness. As if responding to archetypal rhythms and forms, her paintings share underlying impulses that animate her tableaux of abstractions. Color takes on a central importance, with modulating harmonies inflecting atmospheric resonances and providing a sense of momentum within her compositions. Moreover, Cunat often blurs the divide between line and color, using swaths of color to delineate forms rather than line. Cunat has previously worked with the mediums of sculpture and and installation, creating immersive environments that depict traditional Shaker meeting houses and American church architecture; her current paintings reflect a similar turn towards interactivity, embodying whimsical and playful qualities that beckon the viewer’s engagement.

 Like Cunat, Zach Seeger paints with an astute awareness of the allusive and formal potential of color, though his subjects are often representational. Contrasts of light and darkness, interior and exterior, and privacy and voyeurism define his paintings of suburban homes and their inhabitants in Field Days, lending them an otherworldly “inside out” quality. Scenes of domestic life flow into the into the outside world and vice versa, as if separated by a mere membrane, and the solidity of things are undermined, rendering walls and other structural elements as precarious, indeterminate forms. Seeger’s brushwork is extremely fluid, with patches of light and color dancing around his loose, open ended compositions, seldom allowing them to resolve in a moment of stillness. Abstract forms recalling Cunat’s biomorphic imagery appear throughout Seeger’s canvases, and he similarly uses color in place of line.

 The whimsical character of the paintings somewhat obscures their undertones of voyeurism and surveillance; the houses are seen from various angles, including aerial perspectives, and the inhabitants seem wholly unaware of the presence of an outside observer. Seeger captures the messiness of life in his work, and his technique functions as a sort of physical analogue of its constant flux. The barriers between the household and the outside world are dissolved, with each spilling into the other, a statement on the impossibility of compartmentalizing the roaring stream of life. His scultpures, “Mother” and “Drunk Pikachu”, diverge from the domestic subjects of the paintings, instead focusing on cultural tropes and symbols. “Mother” recalls prehistoric representations of the female form, while “Drunk Pikachu” distorts the popular character into an absurd oddity.

 Zach Seeger is a painter and sculptor working in Brooklyn and upstate New York. He received his BFA from Binghamton University and MFA from the Rhode Island School of Design. He has exhibited in the stARTup Fair LA, Artspace Tetra in Fukoka, Japan and Life on Mars Gallery, Brooklyn. He has taught 3D Design, sculpture, painting, drawing and graphic design at Brown University, Berkeley College and Binghamton University. He was the director of This Friday or Next Friday gallery in DUMBO, Brooklyn from 2013-2017.
 Amie Cunat lives and works in New York, NY. She received her MFA from Cornell University in 2012, a Post-Baccalaureate in Painting and Drawing from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2010, and her BA in Visual Arts and Art History from Fordham University in 2008. Cunat has had solo exhibitions in New York and abroad at the Knockdown Center, Sunroom Project Space at Wave Hill, The Cooper Union, AIRY Gallery, among others. Recent group exhibitions include C+C: Kat Chamberlin and Amie Cunat at Spring Break Art Show in New York, NY, Western Decoy at No Place Gallery in Columbus, OH and Sine Gallery: Berlin at tête, Berlin, Germany.

<![CDATA[
Benrubi Gallery presents When We Were Criminals, the gallery’s first solo exhibition from Mel Frank. Frank, the pseudonym of James J. Goodwin, is the author of three books on cannabis cultivation which have sold more than one million copies. His Marijuana Grower’s Guide Deluxe was the first serious manual on cannabis cultivation, and has been called by the New York Times “as accessible a study at this high level of seriousness as one is likely to find.”

 In addition to growing and instructing others on how to grow, Frank has also been documenting the process visually for more than forty years. When We Were Criminals features images from the late 1970s and early 1980s, when marijuana use was popular but far less acceptable than it is today. His images are playful and sometimes sly without being coy, seductive and fecund and sometimes almost nerdy. In one image, a grower’s face is concealed behind an iconic digitate leaf; in another, a grower seems to be disappearing into a dense stand of fully-grown plants. The hidden identities are no doubt a reflection of the plant’s illegality, yet they can’t help but recall a newly self-aware Adam and Eve in Eden, hiding behind their fig leaves.

 Yet there’s no shame here. Frank’s images are purely celebratory, from the conviviality of a passed joint to a circle of harvesters manicuring buds like a family shucking corn or shelling peas. Details of leaves and flowers delight in the subtle shades of gray and purple amid the textured green, while even more extreme closeups of resin glands have the hallucinatory quality of altered states of consciousness. The overall impact of these images is of harmonious collective activity, cautious but celebratory, and years ahead of its time. As the stigma falls away from cannabis usage and the emphasis shifts from recreation to wellness, Frank’s images acquire new significance in movement to legalize marijuana in the Northeast and the rest of the country.

 Significant for this New York exhibition, most of his field shots were taken within an hour’s drive from Manhattan. During that time, New York authorities were still unaware of what the state’s fertile fields were yielding, unlike in California where helicopters scoured mountainsides, and the DEA searched the countryside looking for cannabis grows.

 It’s been said that if you’ve ever consumed marijuana the plant you imbibed probably has its origins in the horticulture of Frank and his colleages in the 1970s. When We Were Criminals gives a visible narrative to that evolution.

 Mel Frank is the pen name of James J. Goodwin (b. 1944). He served as a shipboard electronics technician in the US Navy from 1963 to 1967 and began growing cannabis in 1968 in his West 78th Street apartment. He received his BS in biology from CCNY in 1975. From his first cannabis growing article published in Rolling Stone’s NY Flyer in 1971 through publications of photographs and critical texts in magazines, beginning with High Times and currently with Cannabis Business Times, to his recent career as lecturer and consultant for the burgeoning marijuana industry, Frank has earned the moniker “godfather of marijuana growers.” His life’s work in the field has been honored by two industry Lifetime Achievement awards. His work in photography is as consequential as has been his instruction: curious, careful, comprehensive, and charming.

Still Big is a group exhibition inspired by 17th century Dutch Still-Life paintings. These works broke away from the use of religious subject matter to depict secular objects like flowers, food, and bones in domestic interiors. These paintings explored quotidian reality as well as larger themes of life and mortality.

 In Still Big, paintings, photos and sculptures are arranged on or around tables designed by NY based furniture designers. These contemporary tableaus employ surprising juxtapositions to evoke erotic, gustatory and optical pleasures as well as poignant allusions to human frailty.

<![CDATA[
In 2014, on the night of July 21st to July 22nd German artists Matthias Wermke and Mischa Leinkauf replaced Old Glory with hand-sewn White American Flags on the two towers of the Brooklyn Bridge to coincide with the 145th anniversary of its German-born American architect’s death. Wermke and Leinkauf were careful to treat the bridge and the flags with respect and followed the U.S. Flag Code. Like an empty canvas, White American Flags invited many readings, multiple interpretations and projections, and became a sensation that now lives in the collective memory of all New Yorkers.

 signs and symbols presents the work of the critically acclaimed and beloved Berlin artist duo and filmmakers Wermke/Leinkauf in their first ever solo exhibition in the U.S.

 Working together across three decades, the duo has developed a dynamic, multidisciplinary practice that ranges from films and installations to performances and architectural interventions in urban environments that tackle, challenge and question the limits of space, artistic freedom and the prevailing boundaries of the public sphere. Their practice addresses historical legacy through an investigation of architecture, the ownership and use of public space, and its appropriation as a place for art. Exposing themselves with no limits, their performative interventions claim spaces as their own. The work is driven by recurrent questions: what is freedom and what are the boundaries of artistic expression; what are the flaws in systems and how can one expose and go around such systems? Through rigorous research and calculations, they find ways to reach the seemingly impossible.

 For their solo exhibition at signs and symbols, a range of work has been selected from various projects that investigate the boundaries of public space in urban environments through different kinds of interventions and performances. In the series Landmarks, hand-sewn flags made from highly visible construction vests, a signature of the duo, are installed in well-known architectural masses, buildings and off-limit sites. In addition to Landmarks, the duo will present for the first time in New York the White American Flags project. For Wermke/Leinkauf, the most powerful impact a work of art in the public sphere can have is to become part of the wider societal discourse of a city’s inhabitants.

 The duo often recites a speech by Bill de Blasio in 2014 while appointing Tom Finkelpearl as cultural senator: “I think it’s safe to say: You can’t have a flourishing democracy without a strong cultural sector, without the ability of artists of all kinds to express themselves, to challenge us, to make us think, to provoke us. And to help us understand what the societal discourse may or may not include.”

 There are inherent elements of illegality and risk involved in their artistic practice and seemingly naughty actions, yet their poetic compositions are carefully thought through; each work is extensively calculated and preceded by years of meticulous planning and research. The duo often spends their time on extensive pre-production in field research, archives, scouting and observation of sites, in addition to physical training before any execution, carefully conceptualizing and balancing the risks in the height of art. The White American Flags, for example, was a project that was 7 years in the making.

 Restrictions and boundaries are seen as opportunities for the native East Berliners. They temporarily override limitations and constraints without permission or invitation. They aim to question common standards and to show the beauty beyond these standards. Their work largely exists only in time and remembrance. As such, their work celebrates a certain moment of freedom, the conquest of architecture, the moment of making a city your own. The ultimate sense of freedom.

 For Wermke/Leinkauf, some of the greatest public artworks would never have existed if artists had waited for permits and permission. They often cite the work of Gordon Matta-Clark who famously climbed the Clocktower Building in Lower Manhattan in 1974, as well as that of Philip Petite, Tehching Hseieh, Trisha Brown and other artists whose un-commissioned actions inspired Wermke/Leinkauf in the development of their White American Flags project.

 With regard to architecture, their interest lies within the Genius Loci: the soul of a space, its history, its beauty, its stories. The story and life of the Brooklyn Bridge’s German born architect, John August Roebling, his son Washington and his wife Emily Warren fueled much of the project’s ethos. In presenting content that is historically and collectively embedded within spaces, the duo proposes a scenario in which these histories and places might hold a universal significance if freed from a fixed set of discourses. The duo’s interventions not only celebrate the history of a space but symbolically alter the Loci of the place with their poetic activism. Although never performed publicly for an audience, their performances forever live on at the scene where occurred; indexically, in photographs and in our collective memory.

 wermke/leinkauf, the celebrated Berlin based artist duo, work on installations and performances/public space interventions dealing with the hidden possibilities of a city. Using various artistic strategies, the conversion of urban topographies and the exploration of its borders, they create temporary irritations that allow new perspectives on ‘everyday’ situations. In their artistic practice, crossing the boundaries of individual freedom serves as an extension of artistic and societal scopes. To question common standards and constraints, they “open” the city by using not only their bodies in performances but also the architecture and the tools of urban spaces. Their work often relates to the Genius Loci and the history of a space. The duo has received numerous awards worldwide, taking them to Athens, Tokyo, Cologne and several locations around Germany. Their work has exhibited internationally in various solo and group exhibitions at venues such as HAM Helsinki Art Museum Finland, Moderna Museet Stockholm, Kunstraum Niederösterreich Vienna, Akademie der Künste Berlin, Manifesta 11 Zurich Switzerland, Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo Japan, Museum of Contemporary Art Denmark, KW Institute Berlin and Eyebeam New York among many others. They have received numerous accolades for their work, including Best German Shortfilm &amp; Audience Award at the International Short Film Festival Hamburg, as well as nominations for best Germans Short film of German Film Academy and European Film Award of European Film Academy.

<![CDATA[
Rests of energy are floating and staying
 They are lost
 Nowhere to join
 Never vanish
 They are looking for a place
 Catch the ancestors
 Let the creek release from us
 Let the fossils sleep
 Atsunobu Kohira

 The Chimney presents a solo exhibition by Hiroshima-born artist Atsunobu Kohira. Since 2015, Kohira, fascinated by the properties of carbon materials, has undertaken a coal pilgrimage from the northern mining region of France, to the Wakayama southern-central sacred mountains in Japan, and finally to the infamously polluted Newtown Creek, the East River’s estuary in Brooklyn. For his first exhibition in the United States, Kohira offers an installation that tangles with religious rituals and spiritual forces as well as the objects’ inner geological lives.

 Coal is born of a sedimentary rock formed from dead plants that accumulate over million of years. Composed mainly of carbon and hydrocarbons, this abundant combustible lives ubiquitously in Earth’s crust as well as the human body. While coal consumption produces energy and life at a global scale, its extraction from the ground transforms landscapes and generates detrimental environmental outcomes. In his exhibition, Kohira references this paradoxical dichotomy that the world continually addresses, but have yet to resolve.

 A 12ft high monolith made of plastic and bitumen erupts from the cemented ground. The rectangular cuboid’s viscous surface glistens through fluorescent lights suspended in mid-air. “The monolith is an assemblage of impenetrable spirits,” explains Kohira. By embodying the estuary’s geological phenomenon that borders The Chimney, the sculpture directly addresses the history of its surroundings. The Newtown creek became the 19th century industrial revolution’s cradle, with oil refineries and chemical companies dejecting their wastes in the waterway at a rate unrivaled in contemporary American history. In erecting a monument that celebrates the Earth’s extracted energy, Kohira transforms the gallery space – originally part of an abandoned distillery – into a shrine for the bleak history of the creek.

 The movement of the visitors is an essential aspect of Kohira’s installation. Drawing on Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s phenomenology, the artist empowers his work with a diversity of sensuous realities. Visitors’ apprehension of the work is dictated by their bodily movements in space and infused with the smell of asphalt, both mild and stifling.

 Six bitumen-paint drawings are installed in the excavated windows of the space, all connected with a 100-foot electrical cable that powers the exhibition. This wire is a borderline referencing the sacred cord in Shinto religion known as Shimenawa. Made of hemp or rice, the twisted straw delimits a sacred enclosure to ward against evil spirits in shrines. Inside The Chimney, the cord connects the past and present of The Newtown creek, all enmeshed in the Monolith. The lines, reminiscent of the first human cave markings seem generated by electricity.

 Kohira apprehends coal as living memory, one compressed by gravity. The physical energy released through combustion, is concomitant to a spiritual journey. In Kohira’s installation, matter is perceived as complex, paradoxical and in a state of becoming, unobstructed by human agency.

James Cohan will present BEST LIFE, an exhibition of new work by Grace Weaver. Grace Weaver’s paintings are vibrant investigations of the life and times of her generation. Weaver paints an atmospheric and accessible world that she describes as “halfway between reality and fable.” Making use of a bright and at times jarring palette, she produces compositions that vibrate with energy and tension, bordering on “too-much-ness.” Within the discourse of painting, Weaver’s ambition is to contribute a voice that fuses art historical and pop cultural references into a visual language that is emphatically feminine.

 Emotive figures with Mannerist proportions populate Weaver’s large-scale spiraling compositions with complicated psychological narrative. Most of the long-limbed, bendy people that stretch across Weaver’s canvases are captured in fleeting emotional states – caught with a forced smile, a self-conscious glance, or a passive-aggressive scowl. This sense of observation – what is means to observe others, or the tangible effects of being observed – serves as a key subject matter in Weaver’s paintings.

Oh, how we speak to the creaturely! In Kricket Lane’s surreal visual world, it’s in a series of half-Imperative, partly-cooing ask-commands: sculptural portmanteaus of nature- and human-made, inspired by her love for and interactions with her dog. Human-to-animal being intra-relations have long been fodder for thought. Jacques Derrida considered his nude self before his cat, Donna Haraway probes the bonds of our canine companions’ “significant otherness,” and Hélène Cixous’ poor, noble dog Fips became zoomorphically emblematic for the wounds of colonialism and anti-Semitism.

 Derrida coined animot to linguistically replace the unnuanced animal; a written bridge to encapsulate the spirit and multitudinousness contained within critters. Lane’s work dwells in that same border crossing of partnership between species and the magnificent and mundane. It’s apt that her work has included comb teeth and grill grates. More uncanny objects: A shell-like husk trimmed with an infinity-curve of faux shearling; a branch simulacra is topped off with a sheep duster; a pair of green socks, delicately carved, become treasure.
 Animal and human creatures share so much, from suffering to mortality and love. That relationship, constantly modified by and with the other, is at the heart of these works. In this ethical alterity, each thing or encounter is more than simply a tool or function. We come up hard on the big metaphysical truth of interdependence: we’re one, many, and in our force dynamics, cannot be left unchanged.
 – Yin Ho

 Kricket Lane (b.1985, BFA Smith College) is an artist based in New York City and Hudson, NY working primarily in sculpture. Her work has been shown in New York at Signal, Unisex Salon, 321 Gallery, RK Projects at Shoot the Lobster, The Smile Face Museum, Molasses Books, and in a solo presentation Emotional Facelift at Weekend Projects; other group shows include Hammock Gallery and 356 Mission in Los Angeles, CA and The Range in Saguache, Colorado. She has had two editions published by Psychiania: Self-Help Aesthetics and Lies. Lane is also co-creator of No Notice, a nomadic exhibition series. She recently completed a residency at Centre Pompadour in Ercourt, France. Forthcoming is a book of her work published by Maga Books (New York).

Higher Pictures presents new work by Aspen Mays. This is the artist’s second solo exhibition with the gallery.

 In a series of large-scale black-and-white and smaller brightly dyed works, Mays pulls from her own archive of images documenting the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo, which hit her hometown of Charleston, South Carolina in 1989. Contemplating a future in which these storms become increasingly destructive and frequent, Mays was drawn to images of taped window panes- a pre-storm ritual seemingly more shamanic than practical in its ability to provide any protection. As Mays writes:

 I’ve collected images of Hugo’s destruction for years, especially from newspapers and magazines, because even though I lived through the storm, my memory of it is so closely entwined with media images. I don’t always remember what I saw and what is a photograph. I find patterns of storm taped windows very beautiful and the act of taping them, as a gesture, to be so futile - hope against hope that the ferocity of the event will somehow be mitigated by the tape keeping the outside out and holding the inside in or just maybe making it a little less bad.

 A suite of photograms, each over six feet tall, mirrors the arched windows of California Dreaming, a Charleston restaurant that appeared in a newspaper clipping on Hugo. The windows are taped in a starburst or asterisk pattern, one that recurs across Mays’ work, with its allusions to symbology, astronomy, and imagery of the night sky. To translate the newsprint image into a life size photogram, Mays undertakes a labor-intensive process that requires her to recreate the window tapings to scale, a physical act fusing her lived memories of Hurricane Hugo and the many photographs of the event. A pendant series made with saturated fabric dyes references the colors of Doppler radar images, the eye of a hurricane and mediated, cartoonish depictions of violence.

 Aspen Mays (b. 1980) received her MFA in photography from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2009. Solo exhibitions of her work have been mounted by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; Light Work, Syracuse; and the Center for Ongoing Projects and Research, Columbus. Mays was the recipient of a 2006 Rotary Fellowship and was a 2009 Fulbright Fellow. She lives and works in the San Francisco Bay Area where she is Assistant Professor at California College of the Arts.

Century Pictures presents a solo presentation of lithographs by the late A.R. Penck made between 1979-80.

 Hidden within the borrowed name of a German glacial geologist (Albrecht Penck) is the initial R. This letter stands as the only intimation to the artist’s given name, Ralf Winkler. Indeed, A.R. Penck employed a constellation of monikers including A-Y, Mike Hammer, Mickey Spilane, T.M., Tancred Mitchell, and Theodor Marx, amongst others. Though this act may seem a playful duplicity to current viewers, these pseudonyms were also a practical necessity to the artist whose career began in the former GDR. While the government at the time espoused a culture of “diversity and vastness,” it had in fact stridently censored, edited and ultimately dictated the output and stylistic inventions of its artists. Both to more easily facilitate the transport of his artworks to patrons and friends in the west, and also to skirt the intense scrutiny of the GDR government’s harassing gaze, Penck continuously invented oftentimes witty or poetic designates. The singular R retained the artist’s identity amidst an involuntary, albeit eventually embraced, schizophrenic existence.

 The lithographs in this exhibition convey an exuberant contrast between his figurative renderings and his experimentation in developing a visual language of simplified figures, patterns, and neo-primitive symbols. Though little in this series of works would outwardly suggest a radical or explosive ideology, they still earned him the scorn of the Secret Police of East Germany who raided his studio in 1979 when many of his works were destroyed. The artist who sought to create a set of codified images that would easily convey an emotion or subjective reality was perhaps a target because of that very codification. Rough lines, intersecting figures, arrows that point to a direction opposing the pre-determined path or viewed as a weapon, were marks that could be seen as aggressive, unyielding to norms, and perhaps conveying a secret message that could only be understood by his peers.

 What is evident in this group of works is a prodigious output against the odds of constraint, a mix of studied, mechanical means of production that also includes the individualistic expressive touches of paint application to make each work unique. A voice that is insistent yet colored by a mood or idea that surfaces no matter how one tries to subsume it, the obstacles that Penck faced in his formative years would evidently amplify his work in the future.

 A.R. Penck (1939-2017) was born in Dresden, Germany and worked between Berlin, London, Düsseldorf, Dublin, and New York City. His work belongs in numerous permanent collections including the Tate Gallery, London; Museum of Modern Art, New York; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Neue Nationalgalerie SMPK, Berlin, amongst others, and was included in the 1984 Venice Biennale and Documenta V, VI, VII and IX. Solo exhibitions of his work have been presented worldwide at Galerie Michael Haas, Berlin; Kunsthalle Bern; Michael Werner Gallery; The Brant Foundation, Connecticut; Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven; Museum Ludwig, Cologne; Gemeentemuseum, The Hague; The Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin; Museo Rufino Tamayo, Mexico City; Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt; and Musée d’Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. He was also a prominent jazz drummer and co-founder of the group Triple Trip Touch (TTT). His estate is represented by Michael Werner Gallery.

You see, what we’re talkin’ about here is an organism that imitates other life-forms, and it imitates ’em perfectly.
 —John Carpenter’s The Thing

 Plein air painting is a weird choice for a contemporary artist, leading the practitioner dangerously close to being labeled a hobbyist or a “Sunday painter” (a creature that seems to exist mostly in ghost stories for people with MFAs). The impulse to paint from nature, in nature, feels antique, more the stuff of historical re-creation than of the serious contemporary artist. Painters Anna Ortiz and Hilary Baldwin embrace this oddity, taking the constituent elements of plein air, the landscape and the figure within it, as their starting points, their paintings not so much a representation of that landscape as an uncanny encapsulation of the friction between painter and subject. Working in nature, with their subject simultaneously the site of their practice, both artists produce a kind of visionary art, capturing what is present but not immediately recognizable.

 Anna Ortiz engages simultaneously with the landscape around her and the landscape of her imagination, populating otherwise pleasant vistas with structures of indeterminate origin and unknown purpose. Even when painted entirely from observation they have an air of unreality, interruptions in landscapes that, despite their beauty, are suffused with a sense of unease.

 In Hilary Baldwin’s work, the environment is both a reflection and projection of the self. She observes the natural world not so much to acquire its likeness as to capture the mood of her relationship to it, creating works in which the landscape unsettlingly returns our gaze, mirroring the painter standing in it. Building frame-like extensions for her paintings, she emphasizes their physical presence to the viewer, such that they appear to be reaching out to meet us.



 Anna Ortiz (born 1979 in Worcester MA, currently living in Brooklyn NY) is a painter primarily focused on creating uncanny landscapes. Her work reflects on global issues through painterly collapses and constructions. Ortiz received a BA/BFA from Tufts University and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston. During her undergraduate years, she spent a year studying at the Louvre in Paris. Ortiz completed her MFA at Tyler School of Art, spending her second year in Rome Italy. Her work has been exhibited at Lesley Heller Gallery NY, Storefront Ten Eyck NY and Galeria Il Polittico Rome.

 Hilary Baldwin is a painter in Catskill NY. Her work has been included in solo and group exhibitions in New York, Chicago, Boston, Toronto, and Berlin. She has attended residency programs at The Ragdale Foundation, The Woodstock Byrdcliffe Guild, and in 2014 received a cultural grant from The City of Chicago to attend The Atlantic Center for the Arts, where she studied with the painter Dana Schutz. Hilary has worked with children, teens, and adults as a teaching artist for over ten years, and an artists’ book featuring her series of food paintings was recently published by Soberscove Press in Chicago. She holds a BFA in painting from The Maryland Institute College of Art and an MFA from The School of The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

Microscope Gallery presents Phototropism, the fourth solo exhibition of works by Allison Somers at the gallery, featuring new works relating to the artist’s long-term interest in and intimate observations of trees, flowers, weeds and other vegetation encountered in her daily life or cultivated in the artist’s personal garden at her residence in the countryside outside of Paris.

 Together the silver gelatin photographs, installation, video and other works in Phototropism – a term referring to the tendency of plants to grow either towards (positive phototropism) or away from (negative phototropism) sources of light – direct attention to the abundance of plant life around us and the resulting and often conflicted relationships that arise, including our ability to appreciate and care for nature at the same time that many everyday activities serve to destroy it.

 The concept of duality is a recurring theme of the works that is addressed most overtly in the 2016 photographic series “Palms”. Somers includes within a single framed work both a negative/solarized photograph (left side) and a positive photograph (right side) of the identical image of California fan palms —the only species of palm native to Western North America — in Palm Canyon, Palm Springs, California. This artist’s pairing of images allows for a more complete view of the picture, with subtle details surfacing on one side that are not visible on the other.

 The video Gravitropism (2018, b&amp;w, silent, 2 minutes 44 seconds) is inspired by the 19th century chronographic studies of plant growth by German botanist Wilhelm Pfeffer and is made with re-workings of a section from a botanical documentary showing the ways plants alter their shape and position in response to gravity.

 An installation “The Artist’s Garden”, begun in 2013, finds the artist examining the artistic trope referenced in the work’s title. In the installation stacks of 4 x 6 inch color c-prints contain images of plants taken by Somers over many years in the settings in which she discovers them including city streets, parks, forests, fields, highways, and private gardens as well as her own. The photos — shot with both analog and digital cameras and for various purposes including as formal compositions, reference snapshots for the creation of her garden, and for documentation of the garden as it develops — are printed from a digital archive the artists maintains and sorts according to criteria such as year, season, botanical family, personal association, location, etc. The video component of the installation consists solely of scrolling text of the scientific names of the plants she has identified to date. Ultimately, Somers in this work challenges the viewer to regard as an artwork not only its rendition as an installation but also the actual garden itself.

 Among other works on view is a series titled “Herbarium” of archival inkjet prints featuring images of preserved specimens from her garden, printed to scale. Although resembling photograms and early examples of photogenic drawing, practices the artist has engaged with for a decade and applied to multiple mediums, the works are created through manipulations of the artist’s digital photographs and offer detail and sense of depth beyond that obtained through the traditional methods.

 Allison Somers was born in Los Angeles and is currently based in Paris, France. Somers is recognized for her work with early photographic techniques, processes, chemicals applied to photographic paper — as well as other materials such as tree bark, rope, and roof tiles, among others — and for her dye on fabric work, video and installations. In New York, her work has also appeared at White Box, Participant Inc., Emily Harvey Foundation, 80WSE Gallery, and Baxter St at the Camera Club of New York, among others, as well as at Futura Center for Contemporary Art (Prague, Czech Republic), Fondation D’Enterprise Ricard (Paris, France), Galerie Joseph Tang (Paris, France), Galerie Praz-Delavallade, (Paris, France), and Balzer Protects, Basel Switzerland (solo). Somers’ work has been reviewed in publications including Artnet, Artspace, L Magazine, Hyperallergic, San Francisco Quarterly, Sculpture Magazine, and Break Thru Radio, among others. Somers received a BS from New York University in 2003 and an MFA from New York University in 2010.

The word ‘building’ is both a noun and a verb: the structure itself and the act of making it. As a noun, a building is shelter that has a roof, walls and stands more or less permanently in one place.

 Ancient households layered sand to cover compacted earth; creating a warm, soft covering that could be replaced regularly. In some dwellings, seed shells such as peanut and sunflower were scattered across the floor. As it was walked on, the oil from the shells would coat the occupants’ feet and become spread out across the ground, hardening its surface while making it more compact, stable, and free of dust.

 Archaeologists use the term, terrazzo, to describe some of the floors created over 10,000 years ago in Neolithic settlements across Western Asia. Excavation notes illustrate beautiful, dusty pads of mottled stone chips pressed and polished into patterns in the ground. This practice continued through antiquity as marble artisans fashioned the floors of their own homes with the leftover marble tile scraps from the days’ work. Today, many of the aggregates used in terrazzo are pulled from the industrial waste-stream, continuing its history of reuse in construction.

 For this exhibition, Ficus Interfaith presents a series of terrazzo frames. These frames, along with an additional suite of sculptures, describe navigating a house. The works occupy two floors, vibrating between the distinctions of display room and domestic space. Windows and doors operate as metaphors for other worlds, portals with the potential to activate your imagination. Embracing the spirit of collaboration and highlighting the pragmatism of reuse, the sculptures invite all to ‘play house’. The gallery acts as a skeleton with borrowed flesh, the unlived foundation of a more complete and separately constructed space.

 Ficus Interfaith (is a collaboration between Ryan Bush (b. 1990, Denver CO) and Raphael Cohen (b. 1989, New York, NY). As much a research initiative as a sculptural practice, Ficus Interfaith pursues projects that focus on their personal and collective interactions with nature and natural history. Their work has been exhibited at Prairie (Chicago, IL), Alyssa Davis (NYC), MX Gallery (NYC) and Gern en Regalia (NYC) and they were artists in residence this year at 2727 California Street (Berkeley, CA) and Shandaken: Storm King (NY).

Koenig &amp; Clinton presents For Now, Nicole Miller’s second one-person exhibition with the gallery. For Now triangulates the artist’s latest digital video with her first foray into the more analog forms of sculpture and light-based installation.

 At the center of the dimmed gallery floor, one encounters the rangy frame of world-class entertainer, Michael Jackson in the sculpture Michael in black (2018). Cast in bronze from molds that were formed by applying plaster directly to Jackson’s skin in 1987, it is hard to determine whether or not Jackson’s kneeling position appears pious or merely pensive. Such is the ambiguity that swirls about monuments as one frozen moment is tasked with bearing the weight of a lifetime.

 With his limbs drawn close, one can also imagine Jackson waiting on a dark stage, his torso tightly coiled in the seconds before his body will be soaked in spotlight and he will spring into step after flawless step with an alacrity equaled only by that of his friend, Fred Astaire. For now, Jackson remains still - paused permanently within the long series of permutations that characterized the entertainer’s ever-evolving persona.

 Around his figure and throughout the room, the words “for now” materialize, shift, expand and contract. Recalling the grand moment of technical sophistication in live concert special effects entertainment from the early 1980s, For Now (2018) morphs through various fonts, colors, and sounds; carving out space through analog laser light, only to vanish and reappear repeatedly. The phrase becomes a spectacle without end, dynamically suspended in eternal return.

 The only continuous sound in the room belongs to acclaimed Italian voice actor, Pino Insegno. Between his animated expressions, Insegno offers an account for why he is sought after to stand in for the voices of Black American actors who star in exported Hollywood films. Within this particular imaginary, in which the temporary act of inhabiting another body takes the form of speaking through its image, we are reminded that every story is colored by its telling.

 Nicole Miller (b. 1982, Tucson) received her M.F.A. from the Roski School of the Arts, University of Southern California, Los Angeles. Solo exhibitions of her work include: Athens, California, California African American Museum, Los Angeles; The Borrowers, Koenig &amp; Clinton, New York; Artists’ Film International: Nicole Miller, Ballroom Marfa; The Conductor, High Line Channel 22, New York; Believing is Seeing, Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Death of a School, Centre d’Art Contemporain, Geneve; Every Word Said: History Lessons from Athens and Tucson, MoCA Tucson; and The Conductor, LAXART, Los Angeles. Miller has also participated in prominent group exhibitions such as: Los Angeles-A Fiction, MAC Lyon (2017) and Astrup Fearnley Museet (2016), Oslo; The Campaign for Art, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (2016); Portraits and Other Likenesses, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (2015); Made in L.A. biennial, Hammer Museum, Los Angeles (2012); Dallas Biennale, Dallas Contemporary (2012); and The Bearden Project, Studio Museum in Harlem, New York (2011). Miller has been the recipient of the: John Simon Guggenheim Foundation Award (2018), Rome Prize (2016), William H. Johnson Prize (2015), Rema Hort Mann Foundation Grant (2013), Artadia Award (2013), Louis Comfort Tiffany Biennial Award (2012), among others. Miller currently holds the position of assistant professor in the department of visual arts at the University of California, San Diego. The artist lives and works in Southern California.

<![CDATA[
CANADA presents Friends and Strangers by Katherine Bradford, the artist’s second solo exhibition with the gallery. This show finds the artist channeling an environment of febrile political and social change through paintings of individuals and groups negotiating communal and emotional spaces. Simultaneously, the works maintain a hard-won painterly detachment and stand as a chronicle to her own history and artistic journey.

 Bradford’s paintings, while steeped in figuration, have an internal logic that clearly addresses Modernist painting of the quieter branch (Milton Avery, Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko). The paintings are built from wide expanses of color which lock the surfaces of the paintings into cohesive planes of thought at once taut and inviting.

 Her color palette has shifted: confident blocks of moody pinks, deep blues and hot fluorescent yellows are broken up into scruffy fields with arches, chunky lines, opaque shapes and bisecting marks. The paintings feel lit from within - not quite interior or exterior - and give the sense that each is its own hermetic universe, operating with distinct moralities and peculiar gravity. Figures float, lean, embrace, overlap, and are subject to erasure. The layers and modifications Bradford leaves for the viewer seem to allude to her first impulses when approaching blank canvases with vague notions of what each painting will be about.

 In All of Us, a ten-foot diptych, a crew of elongated and featureless figures march across a pink expanse. The characters nonchalantly ignore a naked female character; she is drawn across the composition and lays recumbent on a field of white spikes (or perhaps buoyed by sprays of breast milk.) The indifference of the figures to one another in an otherwise jaunty painting suggests a loneliness and isolation felt even amidst a crowd.

 Bradford’s figures occupy spaces less as individuals but as chunks of humanity. Each one seems lost in some sort of incomprehensible social or bureaucratic predicament. Dinner tables, business meetings and days of leisure by the shore are all equally weighted with both angst and suggestion. Bradford’s characters can be featureless, but she signals identity through curious and playful depictions of power suits, ties, hijabs or high heels. Some figures seemingly stand for vulgar authoritarians, while others recline - possibly portraits of friends or intimates - painted with hints of both humor and pathos. These paintings do not preach, but offer themselves as residue of psychological introspection.

 Katherine Bradford was born in New York City and is currently based in Brooklyn. She has exhibited widely in New York and abroad at venues and galleries such as: MoMA P.S. 1, The Brooklyn Museum, Sperone Westwater, New York; Philipp Haverkampf Galerie, Berlin, among others. In 2017 she was the subject of a solo exhibition at the Modern Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas and was included in Prospect.4: the New Orleans Triennial. Bradford is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and a Joan Mitchell Grant. She has taught at institutions such as Yale School of Art and Skowhegan, and for many years served as MFA faculty for the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. Her work is in the collections of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, and the Portland Museum of Art. A catalogue of the artist’s recent paintings will be published by CANADA this fall in conjunction with the exhibition.

“I love repetition. Repetitions turn time into a place, turn the days into a space. Repetitions form the foreground, middle-ground, and background of the picture plane. And inside this plane, the lattice work of routine stills. It’s as if time is suspended, since every gesture and movement echoes the preceding one, and, in this way, holds time within itself.

 The routine of drawing a line, day in and day out, somehow makes the avalanche of days and months manageable, for if one repeats the same thing and holds steady this place in time, then it feels like time flows only on the outside.”
 -Aditi Singh

 Thomas Erben Gallery presents so much the less complete, an exhibition of new and recent works on paper by Mumbai-based artist Aditi Singh. This is Singh’s second solo exhibition with the gallery.

 A meditative and meticulously skilled artist, Singh works with tenuous mediums: ink, graphite, and charcoal. Using cumulative and repetitive processes, Singh builds transparency and light through density, achieving an abstraction that evokes the material and the ethereal—a recitative practice in which her applications on paper suggest an inner space of concentration and material expression.

 For the works collected in so much the less complete, Singh painted, layered, and built ink in exacting, aqueous geographies. While evocative of natural processes—suggesting pools, ridges, and channels—these images and forms are actually drawn, built, and controlled through several applications of ink. The frequency of Singh’s line, repeated brushstroke after brushstroke, takes on a painterly velocity that extends over the course of a work. Though the artist keeps a time-log for each piece, documenting the layers to realize the intensity of color, the flow of ink is very much about opening up opportunities rather than controlling them.

 In contrast to East Asian Ink painting, which has developed from writing and representation, freeing itself only recently from this tradition by emphasizing materiality and exploring non-representation, Singh’s practice has always been abstract. Using cumulative and repetitive processes, Singh achieves an abstraction that is not just visual in the Western sense, but carries the affect of Eastern disciplines that inform her: philosophical texts, Vedic hymns, and yoga practice. It is this interdependence between these influences and her material expression which marks Singh’s work as unique, even in the wider context of contemporary ink painting.

 Minimal yet not minimalist, these new pieces articulate a charged realm: their crystalline, organic forms insinuating a struggle between balance, stasis, and continuity, where meaning is not a singular, fixed entity. Ultimately, Singh’s works unearth a kaleidoscope of vulnerabilities, uncertainties, and contradictions—as mirrored in the title of one of her pieces, the fragility of what we call civilization—and, in doing so, perhaps impart a sense of peace over this inexorable process. Cumulative, methodical, and patient, Singh does not so much build onto paper as into it, laying down an obverse domain of line, color, space, and contemplation.

 Born 1976 in Assam, India, Aditi Singh’s works have been exhibited extensively in solo and group exhibitions. This gallery showed Singh’s solo exhibition, All that is left behind, in 2016, and most recently presented her in a collaboration with German artist Olaf Holzapfel at Art Cologne 2018. Other exhibitions include: DECK, Singapore; Chemould Prescott Road, Mumbai, India; SOMA Drawing Center, Seoul, South Korea; National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, Japan; Gallery Barry Keldoulis, Sydney, Australia; and Arthur Ross Gallery, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA. Singh’s works are held in several private and public collections, including the Bob Davoli Collection and the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art. She studied painting at the New York Studio School, subsequently earning an M.F.A. at the University of Pennsylvania in 2001. Singh currently lives and works in Mumbai.

Chambers Fine Art presents Shang Yang: New Works. The exhibition will be held in two locations, in Chelsea and at ArtFarm, Salt Point, NY.

 Although individual works by Shang Yang (b.1942) have been exhibited in the United States, his work has never been shown in depth. The current exhibition, only the fourth in his lengthy career, will concentrate on work produced in 2017-2018 and will be accompanied by a substantial catalog in which essays by John Tancock and Wang Min’an provide essential background for an understanding of these ground-breaking works.

 Although born in 1942 in Hubei province, China, Shang Yang was nearly forty years old when he first won wide acclaim with the painting Boatmen of the Yellow River in which he abandoned the Socialist Realist style that prevailed in China at the time and embarked on a career of restless experimentation that continues until the present day.

 In the late 1980s and early 1990s, ‘85 New Wave appeared, the wide-spread proliferation of artist associations that occurred in China in response to the influx of information regarding contemporary art, literature and philosophy in the West during the 1980s. Although Shang Yang was less affected than artists of a younger generation by the stylistic experimentation, he entered a brief period of stylistic polymorphism. The most important of these phases occurred in 1988-1989 when he executed a group of abstract paintings titled States in which the focus was on the nature of the materials.

 In 1992 he painted Great Landscape, a stylistically hybrid commentary on the way in which the environment in China was being affected by rapid urbanization and the unbridled development of capitalism. Shang Yang’s landscapes became increasingly tormented, the omnipresence of volcanoes representing the powerful, destructive forces welling up inside seemingly stable outer forms.

 An important development occurred in 2002 when Shang Yang painted Dong Qichang Project - 2, a large horizontal triptych that reflects on the degradation of the environment. This was to be the first of a series of thirty-eight remarkably diverse large-scale paintings in which, using Dong Qichang as a reference point, Shang continued his exploration of painterly effects and found materials.

 Another turning point that is the immediate precursor of the works in the current exhibition occurred in 2012 when Shang Yang decided that Dong Qichang Project –33 was lacking in the tension that was a crucial aspect of his sprawling compositions. Over a period of two years, he partially dismantled it, retaining some elements in different locations in the composition and adding others, resulting in the ten-panel work Remaining Mountain. This led to further variations on the Dong Qichang Project, and was the precursor to the related series Remaining Water. Remaining Water No. 1, 2015, was created in response to the Three Gorges Project that Shang has referred to as “a huge sociological and environmental disaster.”

 Shang Yang’s deep concern with the deterioration of the physical environment has only deepened since then. “Yes,” he has remarked, “I am absolutely pessimistic. There is a wide-spread recognition that global warming is undeniable.” The alarming proliferation of extreme weather conditions in recent years has only deepened his despair.

 The works that have resulted from this attitude – Decayed Landscape, Cataract, and Cataract Sections – will reveal to Shang Yang’s admirers that far from resting on his laurels, he has entered a new level of daring in the restless experimentation that has characterized his entire career. Although not included in the present exhibition, Decayed Landscape - 1 (2017) reveals a new urgency in Shang’s response to the global situation, the aggressively scrawled word “decaying” virtually obliterating what remains of Dong Qichang’s world. In Chelsea, two new additions to this series – Decayed Landscape -2 and Decayed Landscape -3, developments of the pictorial language first established in the Dong Qichang Project will be accompanied by four works titled Decayed Book, each one representative of a major component of civilized discourse, Literature, History, Philosophy, and Logic. As Wang Min’an asks in his introductory essay, “What is the cause of all these decayed landscapes and bad earth? Shang Yang exposes the background: the decaying of the landscape results from the decaying of humanistic knowledge and the decaying of ideas.”

 At ArtFarm the Cataracts and Cataract Sections will surprise even those most familiar with the arc of Shang Yang’s career. What exactly are these mysterious abstract works, the Cataracts mostly presented like unidentifiable relics in Plexiglas boxes and the unframed Cataract Sections that hang in front of the wall rather than being attached to it like a painting? The Cataracts derived ultimately from the first Painting Albums of 2008 in which the partial removal of a layer of synthetic material from the surface of the works was a revelatory moment for Shang. “There was pleasure in tearing,” he commented recently.

 The Cataract Sections lack the visual evidence of destructive actions that characterize the Cataracts and are much more impassive. From a distance they resemble geological specimens but closer inspection reveals that all kinds of extraneous matter are included in the mix. Are they beautiful or are they repulsive, or are they both at the same time. As described by Wang Min’an, “Shang Yang uses chemical substances directly as ready-made materials…..Why does he use such materials? There is no doubt that these chemicals are the most serious causes of the destruction of the earth. In other words, on one hand Shang Yang displays the reality and the results of the destruction of the Earth, on the other he displays the materials which are destroying the earth.” Cataract –Mysterious Object represents a new departure for Shang Yang, a three-dimensional object fabricated from resin and cellphone placed on the floor that emits a feeble light at irregular intervals.

 Shang Yang believes that the role of the artist is to reveal profound truths about society, not in a didactic manner but through creating works of art that stimulate viewers of his works to ask questions, not only how they are made but what they mean. Decayed Landscape, Cataracts, and Cataract Sections are exemplary in both respects.

TOPAZ ARTS presents Pierre Ardouvin, a prominent Paris-based artist in his first solo exhibition in New York, Le couvert est mis (The table is set). Ardouvin’s works, widely exhibited throughout France and internationally, are often presented as a journey into the hazardous byways of consciousness and memory. Conjuring strange visions out of everyday reality, his installations, sculptures, and drawings are flooded with memories that are both personal and collective. Seemingly familiar scenes or objects that make up his work become distorted under the effect of an unsettling juxtaposition of senses, combining chaos, joy and nostalgia – producing a sense of déjà-vu without distinction.

 This exhibition features a new installation Le couvert est mis (The table is set) made specifically for the Topaz Arts space during his one-month artist residency. Using ephemeral construction, a set table, raised on columns of bricks placed on top of one another, Ardouvin creates an inviting yet precarious table scene, evoking a distant memory of a horizon, which as a child, seemed so high up. Presenting a collection of works referencing the domestic and familiar sphere of the home, the artist uses objects such as curtains, a table, chairs, dishes and construction bricks (echoing the surrounding architecture of residential buildings in Queens and Brooklyn), recomposed and reused throughout the space.

 Also on view are new drawings by Ardouvin, and his sculptural series “The night is not over”, (title extracted from the poem “Isolation” by Michel Houellebecq). Thick velvet curtains with large printed images of caves are attached to the walls. Placed on the floor and peeking out from underneath the curtains are a pale grey cast of a pair of feet are visible, yet the body disappears within the curtain’s folds and the cave-like images. An encounter with clandestine appearances of a world in-between, blurring the stability of the limits between the inside and the outside, past and present, the space of the portrayal and the portrayed.

 Pierre Ardouvin was born 1955 in France, and lives &amp; works in Paris. He was nominated for the Marcel Duchamp prize in 2007. His works have been shown throughout France at Palais de Tokyo (Paris); MAM, Muséum of Modern Art d’art (Paris); MAC/VAL, Museum of Contamporary Art d’art of the Val de Marne; among others; and internationally at Jumex Fondation (Mexico); Mori Art Museum (Tokyo, Japan); NMCA Museum (Seoul). He is represented in France and in Los Angeles by Praz-Delavallade Gallery Paris/ Los Angeles and by Yoko Uhoda Gallery at Liège et Knock (Belgium). www.pierreardouvin.com

<![CDATA[
Born and raised in Queens, NY to Norwegian/Dominican parents, the collaborative team of artists and sisters Lisa and Janelle Iglesias work together as Las Hermanas Iglesias, a moniker that locates their identity within the historical and philosophical contexts of feminism, teamwork, and multiplicity. Over the past ten years of the artists’ collective art practice, Las Hermanas, have worked formally and informally with their mother Bodhild as well. For their latest project at Ortega y Gasset, Las Hermanas Iglesias have further expanded this familial cooperation, actively including Lisa’s son, Bowie, in the development and creation of LOOPS AT A SPOOL. The exhibition features a dialogic call and response between the four family members, across 3 generations and multiple mediums.

 LOOPS AT A SPOOL features works on paper, created by Las Hermanas Iglesias, alongside textile counterparts that function as visual translations, knit by Bodhild. As the matriarch of the Norwegian-Dominican family, Bodhild has long played the role as translator, the only member who speaks Norwegian, Spanish and English fluently. Growing up in rural Norway, Bodhild cultivated a deep intimacy with knitting and other textile traditions such as weaving and embroidery, techniques she now instrumentalizes as translational processes.

 Her youngest grandchild and namesake, Bowie, is six years old. Understanding his role as co-conspirator and interpreter, Bowie’s contributions are mischievously placed throughout the gallery, serving as echoes and responses to the specific forms and stories he discovers in his collaborator’s work. This exhibition marks the first time that Lisa, Janelle, Bodhild and Bowie are exhibiting work created in concert with each other as Familien Iglesias.

 While childhood has been imagined as the most fearlessly creative time in one’s life, children are often regarded as a major distraction to a professional, critical practice. Eschewing this notion as well as the tradition of the solitary (and usually male) cultural producer, Familien Iglesias is interested in exploring and celebrating the ways in which the multiple members influence, distract, reshape and finish each other’s aesthetic sentences. Like the palindromic title suggests, the works in LOOPS AT A SPOOL are motivated by a rhythmic back and forth dialogue, a sense of play and an exploration of how ideas translate between different materials, laying bare the commonalities and glitches between objects and phenomena.

 Las Hermanas Iglesias is the project-based collaboration of Lisa and Janelle Iglesias. For their project at Ortega y Gasset Projects, the artists have extended their collaboration to include their mother, Bodhild, and Lisa’s son, Bowie, under the collective name Familien Iglesias.

 Bodhild Brendryen Iglesias was born in Folldal, Norway, and moved to NYC when she was 20. Shortly thereafter, she fell in love Bienvenido, a political scientist from the Dominican Republic, whom she married and raised 4 daughters in Queens, NYC with. Bo worked as a NYC Public School teacher for 12 years, has been skiing since she was 2, knitting since she was 9, and has collaborated with her youngest daughters off and on for the past 10 years. She is the only Iglesias family member who speaks English, Norwegian and Spanish fluently (in addition to some German and French).

 Lisa received her MFA from the University of Florida where she is now an Assistant Professor of Drawing &amp; Painting and mother to Bowery Katskill Gerlitz Iglesias. Janelle earned her degree in Sculpture from VCU and and is currently a Visiting Assistant Professor of Sculpture at Carnegie Mellon University. Lisa and Janelle’s individual &amp; collaborative work have been exhibited at El Museo del Barrio, the Queens Museum, Sculpture Center, Abrons Art Center and other spaces. As a team they’ve been artists in residence at the Cité Internationale des Arts through LMCC’s Paris residency program, Fanoon: Center for Print Research at VCU Qatar and Stoneleaf Retreat in New York. Their individual and collaborative work has been supported by the Queens Council for the Arts, NYFA, NALAC, The Joan Mitchell Foundation and the Pollock-Krasner Foundation. Las Hermanas maintain an ad hoc studio in Queens while working on projects in lots of places.

Adam Liam Rose’s Threshold is an installation of objects, video, and a tunnel constructed of collapsible frames. While site specific, the work is built as a film set in flux, with the idea that it may operate in another context. The installation turns the gallery’s entryway into an underground “safe” space or shelter, continuing the artist’s exploration of physical, economic, and social accessibility within space, and pointing to invisible systems that create limited access. The work recalls Israeli bomb shelters, convict escape tunnels, smuggler routes, brutalist bunkers from WWII, and catacombs. As the architecture of the gallery does not allow for indiscriminate entry, Rose is interested in highlighting the failures of infrastructure and of the language of inclusion within art spaces and other sites of public exchange. While marking a ceremonial transition of the body from the street into the “sacred” space of the gallery, the threshold in this installation refers to a line of access, a point of entry, and to a point of no return. In this way, the work alludes to the precipice between life and death.

 In the case of a natural disaster or nuclear explosion, whose bodies are most protected? In what ways do communities deal with these dangers, and in what ways does culture relegate them to the imaginary, the screen, and the immaterial? How does one’s relationship to a given environment transform in the physical body versus the screen? What dangers are perceived? What spaces, if any, are safe?

 Adam Liam Rose (b. 1990) is an interdisciplinary artist working across sculpture, photography, video and installation. Born in Jerusalem and raised mostly in the United States, his works investigate the aesthetic systems of power embedded within architecture. Rose has exhibited at museums and institutions including the Jewish Museum (New York, NY), the Chicago Artists Coalition (Chicago, IL), Marinaro Gallery (New York, NY), Mana Contemporary (Chicago, IL), Sullivan Galleries (Chicago, IL) the Pfizer Building (New York, NY) and others. He was awarded residencies at the Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts (Omaha, NE), Ox-Bow School of Art (Saugatuck, MI), A-Z West: Institute of Investigative Living (Joshua Tree, CA), the Vermont Studio Center (Johnson, VT) and the Chicago Artists Coalition HATCH Residency (Chicago, IL). In 2018 Rose acted as a Fellow within the Art &amp; Law Program (New York, NY), he received an Artis Contemporary Residency Grant, and will be a participant in the Bronx Museum of the Arts’ AIM Program. Rose received his BFA in Fiber &amp; Material Studies from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (‘12) and an MFA in Sculpture from Columbia University School of the Arts (‘17). He Lives and works in Brooklyn, NY.

SARDINE presents a group show titled Italicized Reality featuring work by Liz Ainslie, Andy Cross, Christopher Dunlap, Robin Kang, Jennifer J Lee, and Dana Powell.

 “Access to an alternative reality, a “beyond” where the usual physical laws don’t apply and various manifestations of cosmic consciousness or divinity present themselves as unmistakably real” – Michael Pollan, How to Change your Mind

 Many parallels can be drawn between Michael Pollan’s new book regarding the science of psychedelics, and the artistic experience of creation. In both, personal visions are explored. Space becomes defined, by modeling forms using value and color. Time is necessary for creation. The idea, the ephemera, becomes grounded in material richness. Through the hands of these artists the ineffability of a mystical experience is underscored, and reality is italicized.

 Liz Ainslie is a painter living in Brooklyn, NY. Ainslie received an MFA from Tyler School of Art in 2004 and a BFA from Alfred University in 2001. She has had solo exhibitions at Transmitter Gallery and Airplane in Bushwick, Brooklyn, Creon Gallery in Manhattan and The Cohen Gallery at Alfred University. Her work has been included in shows at Station Independent Projects, Orgy Park, Ground Floor Gallery, Outlet Fine Art, Centotto, Parallel Art Space, Small Black Door, SARDINE and A.I.R. gallery in Brooklyn; Valentine in Ridgewood, Queens; Lu Magnus, Artjail and Spazio 522 in Manhattan; Vox Populi and Ice Box Project Space in Philadelphia; BCB Fine Art and Imogen Holloway in upstate New York, and Gallerie Kritiku, Prague, Czech Republic. Her work has been reviewed in Giornale Dell’ Arte, ArtCal Zine and The GC Advocate. Interviews with the artist can be found on blogs including And Freedom For, Pencil in the Studio, #fffffff Walls, Standard Interview, Otino Corsano. Her work is included in the Pierogi Flat Files Ainslie was a visiting artist at Trestle Projects in 2018, faculty at School of the Alternative, 2017, a resident artist at Millay Colony for the Arts, 2011 and at Atlantic Center for the Arts, 2006.

 Andy Cross (b. 1979, Williamsburg, Virginia) lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. Cross received a MFA from Hunter College in 2005. His work has been exhibited in New York and Internationally. A larger installation titled “House Painter” received a solo show at the Max Mara, Maramotti Family Museum and Collection in Regio Emilia, Italy (2013). In New York and Brooklyn he has had 6 solo exhibitions to date, one is currently up at Zieher Smith in Chelsea. He has also shown with Martos (2013), Kravets Wehby (2006), Cathouse Funeral (2014), and SARDINE (2014 / 2016). Other solo projects were with Mario Diacono in Boston, Massachusetts (2005/2007).

 Christopher Dunlap received his BFA from University of Washington and his MFA from Massachusetts College of Art. Recent exhibitions include Site 131, Dallas, TX; Mckenzie Fine Art, NY, NY; No Place Gallery, Columbus, OH; SARDINE (solo), Brooklyn, NY; Regina Rex, NY, NY; Parlour Bushwick, Brooklyn, NY; Spring Break Art Fair, NY, NY; Centotto, Brooklyn, NY; Space Available, Brooklyn, NY; and GCA (solo), Brooklyn, NY. His work has been written about in The New York Times, Artsy, Art F City, Two Coats of Paint and Travel Magazine. Dunlap’s paintings engage the viewer through a playful, disruptive exploration of color and pattern. These forms create a multiplicity of relationships between simple shapes and complex structures. Through specific placement, repetition, and implied perspective, the paintings assert a sense of depth. By creating an image that can register spatially in multiple ways, the paintings draw the viewer to a heightened awareness of their own visual processes. This sustained attention seeks to bridge a gap between perception and sensation.

 Inspired by her southwestern upbringing, Robin Kang reinterprets the tradition of weaving within a contemporary context. Utilizing a digitally operated Jacquard hand loom, the contemporary version of the first binary operated machine and argued precursor to the invention of the computer, she hand weaves tapestries that combine ancient symbolism, computer related imagery, and digital mark making. The juxtaposition of textiles with electronics opens an interesting conversation of reconciling the old with the new, traditions with new possibilities, as well as the relationship between textiles, symbols, language, and memory. Kang has exhibited throughout the US, Canada, Spain, Belgium, France, Austria, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia. Recent institutional shows include the Queens Museum, the Essl Museum, John Michael Kohler Arts Center, U.S Embassy in Saudi Arabia and Brooklyn Academy of Music, among others. She has participated in artist residencies in Texas, Michigan, Massachusetts, and Beijing. Kang is the founder and director of Penelope, an artist-run project space in Ridgewood, Queens, and also an Adjunct Professor in the Fiber and Material Studies Department at Tyler School of Art, teaching courses in digital weaving and fabric dyeing.

 Jennifer J Lee is a Brooklyn based artist from Pittsburgh, PA. She holds a BFA from Carnegie Mellon University and an MFA in painting from the Rhode Island School of Design 2010. She has studied at École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris France and has attended Skowegan School of painting and sculpture in the summer of 2009. Lee has exhibited at Klaus von Nichtssagend Gallery, Central Park Gallery (LA), Underdonk Gallery, Canada, and the Mattress Factory. Her other projects include Sister, a curatorial platform and guest editor at Black Cat journal.

 Dana Powell (b. 1989 Milwaukee, Wisconsin) lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. Her recent solo exhibitions include Smoke Screen, Allen &amp; Eldridge, New York (2017); Closer Things, SARDINE, Brooklyn, curated by Amy Feldman (2016); and Life Paintings, The Still House Group, Brooklyn (2016). Recent group exhibitions include Pine Barrens, Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, New York, curated by Brandy Carstens (2018); Lure of the Dark, Mass MoCA, curated by Susan Cross (2018); and The skies and the atmosphere most luscious, Allen &amp; Eldridge, New York, curated by Dylan Kraus (2017).

Cuchifritos Gallery and Residency Unlimited presents their eighth annual collaboration, The Impossibility of Form, featuring new work from artists Tomás Cunha Ferreira (Portugal), Tzu Tung Lee (Taiwan), and Kairon Liu (Taiwan).

 Exploring a diversity of subjects—the status of the art object, political action, social inclusion—Ferreira, Lee and Liu reject the rarefied space of categorical definitions moving between materiality and disciplines. Through distinct practices, their work investigates the complex relationship between institutional structures and visual language, and in both composition and content asserts a state of in-betweenness.

<![CDATA[
An unwavering tendency toward the center of a blistering sun. The name of the exhibition summoned in my mind all the times the sun touched my eyes, or rather when my eyes were seduced by the sun’s touch: eclipses, sunrises. Only as those moments waned did I register just how much I had looked directly into it and how exhausted it made my eyes. The feeling builds up, the feeling of having light burned into the visible plane and light preventing perception of anything else but it, in unreal imperceptible colors like pale blues and purples and oranges. But sometimes there are astronomical events and blissful sights that are worth the risk.

 I often think of EJ Hill’s work in celestial terms. He manages to balance the forms of everyday life with sustained gestures requiring massive, life-altering amounts of energy. It is not hard to imagine he has the resolve to stay standing on the platform of Excellentia, Mollitia, Victoria (2018) for months, years, decades longer, like a pillar saint pushing away from earth to commune with heavenly bodies. He has spoken to me more than once of lifting off in the moments during and after a performance, of blasting off or of rising and ascending into the sky. Yet the return to earth, though never explicitly described, is always present. EJ’s work does not encourage us to make him into an alien or inhuman figure, and this is because he does not refuse the social contexts within which he is immersed.

 It is apropos for EJ to have turned to photography, the medium of light, to conduct grounding acts of looking during the shadowed moments of this performance period, through which he can continually situate himself in a specific place and time and with specific people. Photography allows for this detailed immersion in the contexts of what is being photographed. In these images, EJ ties potentially abstracted parameters back to specific referents: gradients of blue turn into the wide open 3pm Los Angeles sky. Moments of figurative monumentality are presented not anonymously, but as part of a social history and material infrastructure. There are very few bodies depicted, and those that are remain mostly in the distant background, worlds away from the photographer. Is it possible to expand current possibilities of representation without abandoning the body? The historical tendency of photography to objectify the very marginalized subjects it claims to be bringing visibility to makes this an urgent question. EJ, an artist who uses his body frequently in his work and who orients his work towards marginalized bodies, understands this risk. He is keen on positing another ethos.

 Photography should also be clear about how the photographer is implicated into what can be seen. The main image with a body in this exhibition is of EJ. He is floating and is poised to completely float away at any given moment; rich blues weave the sky and water into one. Yet what is tethering him to our plane is the cable release of the camera. The camera extends a lifeline of specificity to him. It provides a path back into the physical reality of everyday life once again, back into recognizing one’s body as an inherently social one. The recent sculpture used in his performance, Altar (for victors past, present, and future) (2018) fills the center of the space. By shifting our focus to the means by which a body gets elevated, it serves a similar grounding function. Ever so slight burnish marks on its highest platform indicate that impressions were made on it by a body that has weight. The photographs and the podium lend a crucial amount of gravity to what is about to float away.

 When the 2017 total solar eclipse over North America happened, against common sense I found myself trying to witness these merged celestial bodies through my camera, catching direct glances of sunlight through the viewfinder as I frantically adjusted exposure controls. The crescent-shaped shadows dissipated and I suddenly began worrying that I had ruined my eyesight. I decided the best course of action would be to immediately close my eyes and fall asleep. His eyes are also closed in the photograph, but it seems EJ has found a slim habitable zone within which he can continue to work.

 –Wilmer Wilson IV

 EJ HILL (b. 1985, Los Angeles, California) lives and works in Los Angeles, CA. His practice incorporates painting, writing, installation, and performance in ways that seek to elevate bodies and amplify voices that have long been rendered invisible and inaudible by oppressive social structures. This multifaceted approach often stems from an endurance-based performance practice in which Hill pushes his physical and mental limits as a way to expand the conditions, parameters, and possibilities that determine a body. Hill has exhibited or performed at the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles (2018); Institut d’Art Contemporain, Villeurbanne/Rhône-Alpes, France (2017); Underground Museum, Los Angeles (2017); Future Generation Art Prize at the 57th Venice Biennale (2017); Human Resources, Los Angeles (2017); Commonwealth &amp; Council, Los Angeles (2017); and Studio Museum in Harlem, New York (2016), among others. He was an artist in residence at Praxis Studio, California State University, Dominquez Hills (2017), Studio Museum in Harlem (2015), and Artists’ Cooperative Residency and Exhibitions (2010). Awards and honors include the Radcliffe Fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University (2018 – 2019), the Public Recognition Award, for his participation in Made in L.A, at the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles (2018), Artadia Award, Los Angeles (2018), Victor Pinchuk Foundation Future Generation Art Prize (2017), the Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award (2018), Art Matters Foundation Award (2017), William H. Johnson Prize (2016), Fellowship for Visual Artists from the California Community Foundation (2015), and American Austrian Foundation Prize for Fine Arts, Salzburg (2012). Hill received his BFA from Columbia College Chicago, in 2011, and MFA from University of California, Los Angeles, in 2013.

Fourth Floor

 Gavin Brown’s presents American Quilts 2018, a new exhibition by artist Rob Pruitt.

 For his eighth show at Gavin Brown’s enterprise, Rob Pruitt has produced a series of new works based on American quilt patterns. Utilizing a diverse range of materials and techniques, Pruitt expands upon the tradition of American Folk handicraft to create works that feel both modern and traditional. Thematically, the quilts speak to a culture in turmoil, roiled by a stark political divide within the US and a decline in democratic values across the globe.

 In the late eighties, as half of the artist duo Pruitt-Early, Pruitt’s first public project was entitled Artwork for Teenage Boys. As the artist speaks of it today, “I was thinking about a culture and society that nurtured male dominance, misogyny and general bad behavior. We actively mined record shops, tobacconists and poster stores for mass-produced imagery that manifested this societal participation. It was amazing how much stuff we were able to purchase and archive to prove this thesis. At the risk of self professing our own prescience, we were creating a visual study of our today’s chauvinist culture. Fast forward almost thirty years and as a country we find ourselves being led by a president who is the worst conceivable manifestation of this.”

SHAKEDOWN tells the story of Los Angeles’ black lesbian strip club scene and its genesis crafted by Weinraub over a fifteen-year period that began in 2002. Owned and operated by women, underground and illegal in nature, the club Shakedown is the darker, faster, younger iteration of this dance culture. Shakedown emerged from a post-riots, post-OJ, post-integration but still very racially divided Los Angeles. In this divided city Shakedown is an independent, all black and all female cash economy.

<![CDATA[
The Universe can function in one of two ways: homogenous or isotropic, meaning, it’s either constant in all directions or, though it may seem rigid, there is actually a favored direction buried deep in its fissures. On such fissure is The Cold Spot.

 The Cold Spot is an unusually cold region in the radiation that has drifted in the Universe since the Big Bang. Cosmologists propose that this is a massive Supervoid where 10,000 galaxies are missing, and yet, it is labelled the largest structure in the Universe.

 The Supervoid isn’t an empty hole, it’s more like a patch. It sucks energy from light that slows down as it passes through. Cosmology theory suggests it’s where collisions with other Universes occur, as does gravitational waves which are ripples in space and time.

 Over time, the void becomes relatively shallower – but this is all just theory.

 Ben Morgan-Cleveland will perform geschichten on October 11.

<![CDATA[
Catinca Tabacaru presents artist Rachel Monosov’s second solo exhibition with the gallery, featuring The Blind Leader, a new body of work composed largely of models for imposing limitations on the human body, and manipulating the mind. This continues Monosov’s multidisciplinary practice which consistently [and precisely] addresses micro and macro social implications woven through autobiographical context.

 A banana lies on the floor of the gallery, just outside [or in front of] a fence, A Welcome Gift, inscribed with words in Russian: “my first banana 1991.”

 Loaded with such minimalistic forms made from industrial materials, the works invite viewers to be both performer and witness. The Waiting Room is a metal fencing enclosure - allowing a mental or physical occupation of the space within. The fencing could be transgressed, but the weight of culture seems to make the actors obedient. Through its title, Monosov reflects on “waiting” as an existential state of existence.

 At the meeting point between object and body, is a forced gesture. The limitation of one’s movements is imposed, and quickly becomes one’s nature, without being natural at all. Once conditioned, what actions can one take? Each model creates a scenario that requires a wrestling with social construction.

 The fingerprint taken at a border has a hint of criminality built into the process of identification. This constant suspicion of the individual is highlighted in Monosov’s presentation of Fingerprint. Held by the neck and around the knee, the mobility of the body is challenged while an imprint equivalent in uniqueness and wonder to those found in imposing geological formations is taken as a form of intrusion and control.

 The space; a scenography of a state; a proposal [of a conditional state]. An artist looking for solutions in a system where the language must change. Performative; but instead of choreographing the body, Monosov creates objects to do so. Much as the blind leader has his system of control, rendering us passive; the artist reflects such systems, requiring active thought and movement [a silent protest].

 Further: The Blind Leader, Essay by Mariette Papic
 RACHEL MONOSOV (b. 1987, St. Petersburgh, Russia)

 Monosov holds two MFAs in Filmmaking and Fine Art from The Royal Academy of Fine Arts (KASK) in Ghent, Belgium, and her BA from Bezalel Academy in Jerusalem, Israel. In the past two years, she has exhibited at the Zimbabwe Pavilion of the 57th Venice Biennale in collaboration with artist Admire Kamudzengerere, at the 11th Bamako Biennial, and at the Dakar Biennial; and in museum exhibitions at the BOZAR and Museum Dhondt-Dhaenens in Belgium, and the National Gallery of Zimbabwe in Harare. Her work has been acquired into the permanent collections of the Block Museum at Northwestern University and The Art Institute of Chicago, among other international public and private collections. Monosov has exhibited in galleries, foundations and film festivals globally, and has been the subject of much critical acclaim. She is a co-founder of the CTG Collective, and currently lives and works in Berlin.

<![CDATA[
Danielle Dean’s first solo exhibition at 47 Canal builds from her recent presentation at Fondation d’entreprise Galeries Lafayette in Paris, France, where she premiered her short film Bazar (2018). The film was conceived during time spent by the artist in the archives of the Bazar de l’Hôtel de Ville (BHV), regarded as one of Paris’s foremost department stores since being founded opposite Paris’s Hôtel de Ville in 1856, and today a member of the Groupe Galeries Lafayette.

 Legendary in Parisian retail folklore, BHV is where Duchamp claimed to have bought his bottle rack readymade in 1914. Its name is derived from the Persian bāzār, meaning market, and it was designed to evoke the large, eclectic bazaars of Turkey and Egypt. Dean worked with women from Permis de Vivre la Ville (License to Live in the City), an association that promotes social engagement in Paris’s banlieues (suburbs), many of whom are second generation descendants of former French colonies like Martinique, Algeria, and Guadeloupe. Together they analyzed retail catalogues produced by BHV from the 1880s until the present day, discussing how these construct an image of a normative French consumer. A script, interspersed with language from the catalogues, developed from these conversations and participants from these workshops appear in Bazar’s semi-improvised scenes alongside animated illustrations designed by Dean. In one section, a woman dances krump next to a Nespresso machine, merging her interest in the expressive Californian street dance style with Dean’s investigation into the exaggerated power of consumer imagery. The result is a far-reaching and humorous visual document that combines archival research with a range of personal experiences to interrogate how the circulation of commodities as images has shaped lives historically and in the present.

 Dean regularly takes cultural objects—such as Nike’s True Red sneaker or the Elmina Castle in Ghana, erected by the Portuguese in 1482—as starting points for multi-layered artworks that analyze how subjects are formed in the postcolonial world. Bazar continues her ongoing analysis into the entwined histories of consumerism and colonialism. The catalogues of department stores such as BHV were a key media through which France extended influence into its colonies, and both luxury and quotidian commodities were frequently bought and shipped by mail. Not only did this generate a broad consumer base for French retail, but these documents also established an ideal of French subjectivity that was strikingly white, upper middle class, and Parisian. The sole image of a black woman encountered by the reading group in BHV’s catalogues was of a maid depicted to make bed sheets appear whiter. BHV’s retail literature illustrates a relationship whereby European nations extracted vast human and material wealth from their colonies while enforcing unattainable social and cultural expectations upon colonized subjects through the soft powers of consumerism and desire. This system persists, in intricate ways, in the neocolonial operations of global corporations like Amazon.

 The imperative to consume, and the imagery that emerged conjunctively, reconfigured 19th and 20th century conceptions of space and time. In one animation, Dean depicts a procession of household goods on top of a colonial map, as if these objects are migrating, or marching to work. Processes of fragmentation and dissociation continue to inform how globalization is experienced today. Reflecting this, for the exhibition at 47 Canal Bazar will be split from a linear film into a dynamic three-channel installation. The moving image work is physically extended into the gallery through sequence of cut out standees that have been produced from hand-drawn renderings of items in BHV’s catalogues. These emphasize the way that advertising is experienced as a landscape: as social theorist Emanuele Coccia describes in his book Goods: Advertising, Urban Space, and the Moral Law of the Image, advertising constitutes “a powerful open-air laboratory that produces socially relevant images.”¹ The sculptures function as a physical and conceptual frame for the film, and highlight the art gallery itself as a mechanism of commercial display.

 Scenes from BHV’s catalogues have also been translated into a series of watercolors. Presented achronologically, these excerpt a broad historical range of catalogue pages, from the early leather bound hardcovers to later glossy cover stock. The watercolors investigate the accelerating fungibility of marketing media across space and time, harnessing the imaginary for consumer attention and prefiguring the immersive advertising spaces of today. Characters from the film loiter in the drawings, as if hiding behind larger-than-life goods. Emphasizing the human life that is subsumed in the production of commodities, they call particular attention to the radical presence of the subject who asserts herself, despite and through racialization and colonization, to reclaim history. Dean animates the archive, searching for political openings between its cracks.

<![CDATA[
Big Surprise is the second solo exhibition at Bridget Donahue by writer, filmmaker, and publisher Martine Syms, concurrent to her solo exhibition at Sadie Coles HQ, London, Grand Calme. The culmination of both exhibitions is a synchronized, interactive video installation entitled Mythiccbeing. At Sadie Coles HQ, a large LED screen presents an aspirational self, a digitally-rendered avatar of the artist.

 At 99 Bowery, four video monitors are set to the backdrop of a photographic wallpaper. On the screens we encounter the protagonist Mythiccbeing (my thick being) embodying the postures of his Los Angeles life, as if from the journal pages of a dark shadow:
 Morning
 We follow Mythiccbeing into the bathroom, to his reflection in the bathroom mirror and in the bedroom mirror. He cleans his face, eats a cookie halfheartedly and adjusts his clothing. This is the beginning of the day.
 Afternoon
 Phone in hand, he intermittently scrolls blogs, television recaps, and social media. He takes notes. He wears a shirt with the text across the back: “To Hell With My Suffering”.
 Evening
 Turning from side to side in bed, he modulates his voice as he repeats, “The human race repulses me.” This line either comes from the book he holds in his hand, or from the script of the film. Dancing, and a breakdown into sobbing, interrupt his languid pose. He rearranges pillows, punches them, puts them into place. Various ways to get back to sleep. Or to wake up.
 …
 Gallery viewers can engage in a transatlantic control of both the left and the right brain of the video - the avatar and the actor - through SMS conversation with each protagonist, and inadvertently, in conversation through a chatbot programmed with Martine’s voice. The bot is an algorithmic entity. Inhuman, it has limited, programmed knowledge. The audience engages in conversation with a disembodied engine, and Mythiccbeing answers through animation, images and text bubbles:
 I wish this hotel had room service.
 What does joy look like for me?
 How do I cultivate my joy?
 Are there blocks to my joy? If so, what/who are they? Where is there already joy in my life?
 I think I’m the only black person on this aircraft.
 Big Surprise is a narrative in the process of being live-edited. In describing how she writes an essay, Martine once said that she walks the length of her apartment talking out loud into her voice recorder. The habitual movement of walking from one room to the other triggers speech: “Walking and talking out loud is the fastest way to get to the point.” Martine later transcribes her voice into the computer, but it all begins with talking to the walls, in order to talk to you.

 Martine Syms (b. 1988, Los Angeles) graduated with a BFA from Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson (2017) and a BFA from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago (2007). Solo exhibitions include Contemporary Projects: Martine Syms, Serralves Foundation, Porto, Portugal (2018); Front International: Cleveland Triennial for Contemporary Art Projects, Cleveland, Ohio (2018); 106: Martine Syms, Museum of Modern Art, New York (2017); VNXXCAS: Martine Syms, Camden Arts Centre, London (2017); The Easy Demands, CONDO: Bridget Donahue hosted by Sadie Coles HQ, London (2017); and Fact &amp; Trouble, Institute of Contemporary Art, London (2016). She has been included in group exhibitions including The Body Electric, Walker Art Centre, Minneapolis (2018); Unlimited, Art Basel, Basel, Switzerland (2018); Art in the Age of the Internet, 1989 to Today, ICA Boston, Boston (2018); Speech/Acts, ICA Philadelphia (2017), USA; and Made in L.A. 2016: a, the, though, only, Hammer Museum, Los Angeles (2016). Syms lives in Los Angeles. She is the founder of Dominica Publishing, a publishing imprint dedicated to exploring blackness as a topic, reference, marker and audience in visual culture.

<![CDATA[
Bridget Donahue presents “FAITH CRISIS”, an exhibition of new paintings from Sonya Sombreuil.

 Sombreuil, best known for her alluring underground streetwear line COME TEES, presents a body of paintings that thread personal and universal narratives of the human psyche, echoing imagery seen in her clothing. Ambiguous figures are layered amidst carefully considered wordage in a fauvist palette, suggesting something like sacred moments of heightened sensation. Sombreuil’s paintings have a distorted and discomforting romantic tenderness, invoking multiple references to music, culture and language that invoke rather than describe.

 In “REDUX” the viewer encounters a red figure hunched over contemplatively as fragments of obscure images float around the figure’s head. The figure in “REDUX” is reminiscent of Henri Matisse’s 1910 painting Music, where all the figures are painted red and reduced to musical hieroglyphs. In similar fashion, Sombreuil’s painting is a hieroglyph depicting the artist pensively conjuring its brainchild. Images of other paintings, perhaps in incubation, are seen floating around the figure’s head in states of inchoate thought. The painting shows Sombreuil’s nuanced interest in sublimity and etherea.

 Like a film noir play bill, the title painting “FAITH CRISIS” is an arrangement of words and phrases, creating a barely-there spectre of a 6-pointed star. References to films, music and esoteric texts are graffitied around a central figure. The entanglement of words creates a hypnotic marriage of language and figuration. “Dark Passage,” “In A Lonely Place,” “The World Is Yours,” “Such Sweet Thunder,” etc…familiar phrases from popular culture, concrete to those who can catch the reference, but not telegraphing any specific meaning to the viewer. Read all together, these texts invoke a mood, even a moodiness, but are intentionally open ended, posing a question rather than an answer.

 Sombreuil’s paintings are fundamentally rooted in the supreme governing force of the subconscious and its interplay with the history of painting and culture. Approaching and retreating from the subject via both bluntness (“State Your Name”) and obfuscation, the essential nature of each painting is unsayable. In the words of The Wailers 1966 track, “Who feels it, knows it.”
 
 — Mario Ayala
 Sonya Sombreuil (b. 1986, Santa Cruz) lives and works in Los Angeles, California. Alongside her production of the fashion label COME TEES, Sombreuil has exhibited her paintings at venues including Big Love, Tokyo (2016); Las Cruxes, Austin (2014); Canal Gallery, Holyoke (2013). FAITH CRISIS is the first New York solo presentation of paintings by the artist.

For INTERVALS, Abraham McNally presents a series of over 100 hand carved sculptures made of wood and wool. Poplar and cedar logs were cut and milled with a chainsaw at his childhood home; a Christmas tree farm in Northern Vermont. Raw sheep fleece was collected from a local farm. These simple materials open conversations between past, present, and place. This human-scale sculpture offers a personal visceral encounter: body of sculpture to body of viewer.

 Abraham was born in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont in 1975. He now lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. He received his B.A. in fine arts from Bard College and his M.F.A. from Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts at Bard College. His work has been exhibited in New York, San Francisco, Boston, Philadelphia, China, Germany, Belgium, and France. He teaches at Parsons The New School for Design.

For In-Between at the Invisible Dog Center’s Glass House, Caroline Cloutier uses the mirror as an extension of the photographic device to produce images. She thus brings the out-of-field space inside the Glass House and exploits the visual qualities of its surroundings. The effect is a complex spatial composition that leads the viewer in a contemplative experience about the in-between.

 Caroline Cloutier is particularly interested in the reflective function inherent to specular and photographic images and their capacity for suggesting virtual spaces. In recent years, she has arranged mirrors and large-scale photographic prints to create monumental collages that section and modulate the exhibition space. Blending in with the architecture of the occupied venues, her installations modulate the space, open virtual passages, and effect a mise en abyme within the exhibition setup. They provide contemplative experiences that suggest a space that one might imagine or discover beyond the image. Mental projection leads the body to inscribe itself in these virtual spaces.

 Caroline Cloutier lives and works in Montreal (Canada), where she practices photography and installation. Her works have been shown in Montreal, Toronto (CA), New York (US), Linz (AT) and Rome (IT). She has had a number of international residencies: Linz in 2014 and 2016, Gros Morne National Park, Newfoundland (CA), in 2016, and Rome in 2017. She holds a bachelor’s degree in visual and media arts from the Université du Québec à Montréal and she is currently pursuing a MFA in Photography at Concordia University (Montreal, CAN). Her last installation, In-Between (2018), created especially for the Invisible Dog Center is her first solo show in New York.

<![CDATA[
“In the nights of annihilation of the last war, the frame of mankind was shaken by a feeling that resembled the bliss of the epileptic. And the revolts that followed it were the first attempt of mankind to bring the new body under its control. The power of the proletariat is the measure of its convalescence. If it is not gripped to the very marrow by the discipline of this power, no pacifist polemics will save it. Living substance conquers the frenzy of destruction only in the ecstasy of procreation”. – Walter Benjamin, excerpt in “to the Planetarium” from “One-Way Street”.

 “Art does not reproduce the visible, rather, it makes the visible” – Max Ernst, excerpt from “The Creative Credo”.

 Pedro Wirz continues his second solo exhibition, titled “breastfed tadpole”, at Kai Matsumiya. Consider the world enveloped with office carpet where it serves as the chief nutritive source like soil. In such a world, nature, culture, and technology integrate not as separate entities but as a cohesive ecosystem. Office carpet serves as the soil for twigs. Frog like critters with mammalian components reveal themselves as neither living or dead. Letters represent nothing else but the end of language. Inorganic materials are expected to birth something unwitnessed. Technology itself finally bleeds alongside nature as if both are intertwined as one. Animalistic and insect-like architectures resembling nests, cocoons, and eggs fuse with human cultural practices. Raw new cosmic life abounds.

 Substances from the tropical forests, Swiss parks, junk yards, soil, latex manufacturing, and discarded toys and ornaments comprise the materials of Wirz’s art works. A large degree of the artist’s research for his practice is also informed by his upbringing in the Paraiba Valley, Brazil. The region’s layered, primordial, modern and contemporary landscape has been the site of massive demographic shifts as European royalty, slaves, indigenous people, merchantmen, industrialists, and failed techies collide within its varied multifarious histories. As a result, the region has produced art, architecture, and culture that appear as if all had been undergoing the process of beginning, mixing, and resetting. Part of Wirz’s impetus, then, originates from the adopted spirit and perspective of a child reconfiguring, completing, nd beginning anew lost objects, dying landscapes, and incomplete mythologies of post-apocalyptic and dystopian environs.

 Recent solo and two person exhibitions include Jan Kiefer, Pedro Wirz, 2018 (Galerie Nagel Draxler, Cologne); Fábula, Frisson, Melancolia (Instituto Tomie Ohtake, São Paulo, 2017); Dobrar de Espinho, Anzol (Murias Centeno Gallery, Porto, 2017); and The Horse Who Drank Beer (Kai Matsumiya Gallery, New York, 2016). His work has also been presented at the Tinguely Museum (2016), CCS Bard Hessel Museum of Art (2015), Künstlerhaus Stuttgart (2013), Dortmunder Kunstverein (2013), Palais de Tokyo (2013), and Kunsthalle Basel (2011). In 2016, he was the artist in residence at the Swiss Institute Rome, and he has recently completed a residency at the Akademie der Künste in Berlin.

 Wirz has been awarded the ProHelvetia Cahier d’Artistes Prize 2018 and will have his first monographic book presented in Basel next June, during Art Basel.

 His work is currently on view at the Kunst Raum Riehen in Basel, and Kunsthaus Pasquart, both in Switzerland. Other upcoming projects include solo exhibitions in January at LongTang, Zürich, February at Centre Culturel Suisse in Paris, May at Kunsthaus Langenthal and his debut solo show at Galerie Nagel Draxler.

 Born in 1981 in Pindamonhangaba, Brazil, Wirz currently lives and works in Zürich, Switzerland.

<![CDATA[
Venus Over Manhattan presents The Art of Collaboration, an exhibition dedicated to collaboratively produced works of art. Comprising a tightly focused selection of major collaborations. The Art of Collaboration marks the first exhibition dedicated to artistic collaboration in nearly thirty years, following Cynthia Jaffee McCabe’s Artistic Collaboration in the Twentieth Century at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in 1984, and Nina Castelli Sundell and Susan Sollins’ Team Spirit in 1991.

 The Art of Collaboration highlights a specific type of collaboratively produced art. Featuring work in nearly all media, the exhibition gathers collaborations by artists who maintain independent practices, and elect to collaborate beyond the scope of their individual productions. Variously describing personal connections, artistic affinities and conceptual attachments, many of the works on view testify to powerful relationships; others register the dynamics of influence, or complicate the notion of an artist’s signature style. Others still provide an arena in which to question authorship, or parse responsibility for a given gesture. Taken together, the presentation confirms the persistent presence of collaboration in modern and contemporary art, despite an artistic economy predicated on self-expression.

 The presentation demonstrates a wide range of reasons that drive artists to collaborate, featuring the products of friendship, romance, marriage, physical proximity, shared gallery representation, or specific requests for individual exhibitions. A large-format work on canvas by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol represents a group of collaborative works produced at the suggestion of Swiss gallerist Bruno Bischofberger, and registers each artist’s trademark imagery. A group of works by artists including Basquiat, Keith Haring, Kenny Scharf and Fab 5 Freddy documents a period of intense collaborative energy in New York City, when artists associated with Neo-Expressionism and Street Art spontaneously riffed on one another’s works and surfaces. A photograph of a dress printed with Christopher Wool’s signature wallpaper pattern records a collaborative exhibition with Robert Gober at 303 Gallery in 1988, born of Wool’s admiration for Gober’s work. A multipartite installation by Ed Kienholz and Nancy Reddin Kienholz, featuring a life-sized representation of a husband and wife, attests to the energy of a long-term partnership in both marriage and art.

 Despite uneven attention for such efforts, visual artists have collaborated with varying degrees of intensity throughout the history of art: the workshop model, in which an artist oversees a studio of assistants, was popularized during the Renaissance, and witnessed a rebirth of sorts at Andy Warhol’s Factory. Collaboration became far more common in the twentieth century, which saw artists associated with Dada, Surrealism, and the Cobra group produce collaborative works. Examples of sustained collaboration emerged in the second half of the twentieth century, first as a consequence of married artists jointly signing their work, then as a strategy employed by artists partnering in long-term production. Such partnerships are increasingly common, but collaborations between artists who maintain independent practices remain relatively infrequent. In spite of recognition from both critics and collectors that Western art has always been in certain respects, a collaborative endeavor, the cult of the individual retains a strong foothold in the visual arts. Indeed, the “traditional conception of the artist as an autonomous agent” remains an effective barrier to the production and acceptance of collaboratively produced art. [1]

 The exhibition will feature collaboratively produced works by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol; Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring; Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Fab 5 Freddy, Futura, Eric Haze, LA II, Tseng Kwong Chi, Kenny Scharf, and others; John Currin and Rachel Feinstein; Robert Gober and Christopher Wool; Mark Grotjahn and Jonas Wood; Keith Haring and LA II; Richard Hell and Christopher Wool; Ed Kienholz and Nancy Reddin Kienholz; Jonathan Meese and Albert Oehlen; Tim Noble and Sue Webster; Claes Oldenburg and Coosje Van Bruggen; and Anselm Reyle and Franz West, among others.

<![CDATA[
Polyfocal Allover is the first institutional painting survey of Swiss artist Franz Gertsch (b. 1930, Mörigen) in the United States. The exhibition explores Gertsch’s decades-long commitment to capturing life in portraiture, primarily through photorealist paintings and woodcut prints.

 For the first time in decades, several major works from the artist’s monumental series of ‘situation portraits’ from the 1970s will be reunited, including At Luciano’s House (1973), Luciano I (1976), Luciano II (1976), and Portrait of Urs Luthi (1970). Based on photographs Gertsch took of a group of young friends who had begun living in a commune in Lucerne after 1968, including celebrated artists Luciano Castelli and Urs Luthi, the paintings capture the subjects’ lively presence as social beings in formation, surrounded by a clutter of clothes, makeup and unwashed dinner plates. The extraordinarily rendered details illuminated by the stark light of a camera flash capture an interest in American counterculture, as well as a playfulness with codes of sexuality and gender.

 The exhibition will also feature a suite of Gertsch’s large woodcut prints, a medium which the artist devoted himself to exclusively between 1986 and 1995. Several prints from the series Natascha IV (1988) are based on the same image of a young woman, with a glacial, yet luminous expression. These are accompanied by Schwarzwasser (1991), a study of subtle movement on the surface of a body of water. For the first time, the limewood printing blocks used to print Natascha IV will also be exhibited, revealing the tiny raster-like gouges that Gertsch makes to register points of light.

 Gertsch’s longstanding artistic interest in the mirror as a surface on which a myriad of such identities might be perceived is captured in a small collection of early works. In a number of early paintings, drawings and woodcut prints, including Spiegel (1961), and Mädchen vor dem Spiegel (1960), individuals are seen reflected in looking glasses and contemplating their reflections, pointing to a lifelong interest in capturing the nuances of the self.

 About Franz Gertsch

 Franz Gertsch was born in 1930 in Mörigen, Bern, and lives and works in Rüschegg-Heubach, Switzerland. Gertsch has participated in several important international exhibitions over his career, perhaps most significantly in Documenta 5 (1972) in a section organized by Harald Szeemann, Jean-Christophe Ammann and others, that looked to artists they saw to be ‘interrogating reality’. Other group exhibitions include the Venice Biennale in 1978 and 1999. Solo exhibitions include: Kunthalle Basel (1975); Kunsthalle Düsseldorf, Germany (1975); Sprengelmusuem Hannover, Germany (1980); Kunsthaus Zürich, Switzerland (1980); Museum of Modern Art, New York (1990); Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington (1991); Kunstmuseum Bern, Switzerland (1994); Albertina Museum, Vienna (2006); Mumok, Vienna (2006); Saarlandmuseum, Saarbrüken, Germany; and Musée Jenisch, Vevey, Switzerland (2017). Gertsch has been the recipient of muliple grants and prizes, including the DAAD Grant, Berlin (1974-75) and the Prinze oft he Bürgi-Willert-Stiftung. There is a museum devoted to the work of Gertsch, Museum Franz Gertsch, in Burgdorf, Switzerland.

 Franz Gertsch: Polyfocal Allover is made possible through the support of the Franz Gertsch Exhibition Circle, the Robert Lehman Foundation and Ben Frija. Swiss Institute extends its deepest gratitude to the lenders to the exhibition: Art Collection EFG Private Banking, Zurich; Graphische Sammlung ETH Zürich; The Sander Collection; and a number of private collections.

Nguyen Evil in the Defense of the Good Swiss Institute

 Swiss Institute presents Evil In The Defense of The Good, Julien Nguyen’s first institutional solo exhibition in the United States. Nguyen’s painting practice is at once referential and intensely personal, employing pre-16th century technique to subject matter that ranges from Renaissance architecture to artificial intelligence to the films of Kathryn Bigelow. Often populated by slender and chimeric bodies that oscillate between the historical and the speculative, Nguyen’s paintings pit familiar forms against one another to produce preternatural tableaus. In this exhibition, Nguyen furthers these inquiries with a new commission, his first significant moving image work.

 The video, Spiritus Mundi, is a reenactment of a scene from the director’s cut of Oliver Stone’s 1995 biopic Nixon, in which former US President Richard Nixon and then-Director of Central Intelligence Richard Helms leverage one another in a terse power struggle. What begins as a strategic negotiation of funding and rank escalates into an ominous rumination on geopolitics, hubris, mortality and corruption. Over two decades later, Nguyen’s reinterpretation sees the roles of Nixon and Helms recast with friends from his life in Los Angeles. Alaia Parhizi, a 23 year-old Swiss artist of Persian descent, plays Richard Nixon. Aidan Nelson, a 20 year-old entrepreneur and actor from San Diego, who along with Parhizi runs the art-and-music venue Wönzimer, plays Richard Helms. Austin Norman, also 20 and originally from Palm Springs, plays Nixon’s much aggrieved aide, Deputy Director of the CIA and Lieutenant General in the Marine Corps, Robert Cushman. Costumed in a distorted approximation of political dress, and set in an Orientalist office, these attractive, vampiric young men inhabit their positions through a strange and darkly humorous role-play, grappling with a history that lies just beyond the brink of comprehension.

 Two paintings of Nguyen’s actors hang in the gallery. The artist depicts his subjects as muses in repose, out of costume, in varying states of wakefulness and dress.

 Julien Nguyen (b. 1990) lives and works in Los Angeles. He completed his undergraduate degree at Rhode Island School of Design, Providence, (2012), and subsequently received his Meisterschulle from Staatliche Hochschule für Bildende Künste, Städelschule, Frankfurt (2015). His work has been the subject of a solo exhibition at Kunstverein Munich, Munich, Germany (2014); and has been included in group exhibitions such as the 2017 Whitney Biennial, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY, USA (2017); Parked like serious oysters, MMK, Frankfurt, Germany (2015); and Lost Boys, Glucksman Gallery, Cork, Ireland (2013).

Si Reading Room

 Julia Tcharfas Tim Ivison Science of Rehearsal Swiss Institute

 Swiss Institute presents the second Reading Room exhibition, Science of Rehearsal, conceived by artist and curator Julia Tcharfas and academic Tim Ivison. For Science of Rehearsal, Tcharfas and Ivison have assembled materials from the archives of the Theater of All Possibilities and the Institute of Ecotechnics, drawing connections between their practices through careful juxtaposition of photographs, documents, and objects.

 The Theater of All Possibilities and the Institute of Ecotechnics are perhaps best known for their role in the first two missions carried out in Biosphere 2 (1991-94), the largest and most complex closed-system ecological facility ever built. Originally designed to model the adaptive performance of living systems, the structure contained seven interconnected ecological biomes supported by a vast technical apparatus. In the first mission, eight crewmembers lived for two years within the enclosure, growing, harvesting and cooking their own food, and thereby testing the scientific and sociological possibilities for human life inside biospheres on other planets or in alternative atmospheric conditions.

 Although the Theater and the Institute have addressed distinct artistic and academic communities through their institutional guises, Science of Rehearsal underlines the common framework of performance, rehearsal, training, experiment and improvisation inherent to both. Bringing together zines, photographs, biospherian suits and data reports, fantastical theater costumes and handwritten notes, Ivison and Tcharfas animate the links between art, literature, performance and community in the development of a technoculture able to confront contemporary ecological conditions.

 Julia Tcharfas is an artist and curator based in Los Angeles. Her research draws on materials from modern scientific and technological folklore and often engages with design and performance of artificial natures. A profile about her practice is featured in the Swiss Institute’s ‘SI: Visions’ video series. Tcharfas is the founder of Before Present in Los Angeles and has recently exhibited work in Project 1049, Gstaad; Transformation Marathon, Serpentine Gallery, London; and Fluent Gallery, Santander.

 Tim Ivison is an interdisciplinary scholar working on the political ecology of modern cities and urban planning. He teaches in both Liberal Arts and History + Theory at SCI-Arc and in the department of Humanities and Sciences at Art Center College of Design. Recent collaborations with the artist Julia Tcharfas include 710; Operations Theater; and T.E.O.T.W.A.W.K.I. at Before Present, Los Angeles.

 Based at Synergia Ranch in New Mexico since 1969, the Theater of All Possibilities has pursued experimental performance and embodied ecological research in locations around the world. The Institute of Ecotechnics, also based at Synergia Ranch since 1973 and involving members of the Theater, has been dedicated to studying the intersections of ecology and technics, or ecotechnics. Together, the Theater and the Institute share a mission: ‘to end the separation of science and art,’ inspired as much by Konstantin Stanislavski and Bertolt Brecht as by Buckminster Fuller and Vladimir Vernadsky.

Fortnight Institute presents Visitations, Greg Burak’s first solo exhibition in New York.

 Looking at Greg Burak’s paintings makes the act of seeing feel secretive or forbidden. The paintings invite the viewer to peer into these private scenes, evoking a feeling of transgression. A door has been left ajar, a window open, a cover lifted for the curious to enter and acquire hidden knowledge. The interiors are familiar and comfortable, set up with books, paintings, plants, furniture and a cat, in one case. The figures in Burak’s work are mysterious, facing away mostly, as they are completely engaged in their environment. In Visitations, Burak’s paintings pulsate with tension, presenting scenes that are both unsettling and intriguing, culling elements from both the mundane and esoteric. The dichotomy between the ordinary and the peculiar leaves the viewer with a myriad of questions. In Burak’s painting, Vision, the center figure’s hand is a mossy green echoing the color patterns of the square apparition floating above a mysterious portal that leads to somewhere/nowhere. Why is the hand green? What is this appearance of a green diaphanous square? The figure in the yellow shirt holds a thin wooden stick or wand? The window behind them: is it a window or an illusion?

 I was once the steward of a book of magical spells. It sat in a conspicuous place on my shelf, catching my sidelong glance. One night a friend suggested that we perform one of them. While the possibility of conjuring something into being was tantalizing, I was simultaneously terrified at what these spells could awaken. I hastily declined – much to my own chagrin and the amusement of my friend.

 I realized then I wasn’t prepared for the possibility of this actually working. I thought I was looking for confirmation of something otherworldly, but how could I move forward knowing that there were uncanny forces at play? Something just beyond the edge of human perception?
 Would I have to rethink the Catholic system I had abandoned? Some biblical force might not have been pleased with my infernal dabbling. It seemed that everything was on the table, and the possibilities overwhelmed me. It was a conundrum that I decided to avoid; I settled on agnosticism and moved on.

 Although my direct interaction with the supernatural was put on hold, I can’t help but wonder what may have happened. These paintings are about the possibilities of a foray into the paranormal. I’m interested in capturing the faltering moment at the threshold between the everyday and the supernatural. Although some of these player’s attempts may be half-hearted or unpolished, it’s hard to say what might reach across the void. - Greg Burak

 Greg Burak was born in 1986 in Haverstraw, NY. He received a BFA from the Maryland Institute College of Art and an MFA from Indiana University. His work has been included in exhibitions at Gitler &amp; _____, Trestle Gallery, and First Street Gallery. He currently lives and works in Queens, New York.

Curated by Raul Zamudio and Juan Puntes with Peter Wayne Lewis

 Since the twenty-first century, the U.S. seems to be in a state of accelerated social transformation and this has been cause for alarm for many conservative, White Americans. One of the most notable benchmarks of these changes is Barack Obama’s election as America’s first African-American president. Researchers also predict that in the coming decades, Latinos/Hispanics will be the largest demographic in the U.S. superseding the current White majority. Other communities that have been historically marginalized and now ostensibly asserting their rights including LGBTQ+, have added to the perception that we are living in a different America than in the past. Another phenomenon altering the American social landscape is the influx of immigrants that some construe as potentially usurping the purported dominant culture and its traditions. Even Donald Trump’s campaign slogan of Make America Great Again, subliminally harks back to a reactive era of intolerance and exclusivity.

 White Anxieties is a mixed media, international group exhibition that takes the pulse of what haunts the conservative, American psyche. That is, an anxiety-inducing America that is less white, heterosexual, and male, and where other languages than English are spoken and where People of Color can openly express their cultural traditions without accusations of not being “real” Americans. Some works in the exhibition, for example, address the dismantling of Confederate monuments, the problematics of assimilation, and xenophobia’s prevalence while others target the most disturbing manifestation of American socio-political regression and of an America historically unresolved: David Duke and acolytes who run for political office while attempting to normalize their racial supremacist ideology.

 #subculture @storefrontnyc @theliving.studio @ehenaff @slavin_fpo

 What are the microbial metrics of our urban spaces?

 The species that occupy our cities are much more abundant and diverse than we know. The “Tree of Life” — an index of all biological organisms on earth — indicates that 99% of all life on earth is invisible to the human eye, both unnamed and unnoticed. Archaea and bacteria dominate the genetic weight of nature, consisting of everything from pathogens that give us the flu, to microbes that raise plants from soil. It is in our cities, however, that microbial ecologies are uniquely complex. Cities are filled with people, and these people are in turn filled with billions and trillions of microorganisms.

 Over the past decade, this notion has become familiar through the popularization of the so-called “human microbiome,” a unique microbiological ecology in the gut of people. But does New York have a gut biome? Is it different from the gut biome of Tokyo? Lagos? Hyderabad? Is the gut biome of Soho distinct from the gut biome of Jackson Heights? How does diversity, demographic and microbial, affect medical, social, and even interpersonal outcomes for the people who live in each city?

 The “culture of cleanliness” around health and domestic spaces has framed microbes as pathogens, disease agents to be avoided and repelled at all costs. From the chemical sanitization of sheetrock to the controlled acidity of concrete in new construction, thousands of anti-microbial decisions are compounded in the design and policy of our cities, undermining the importance and actual presence of legitimate bacterial diversity in our urban lives.

 Until recently, it’s been impossible to understand exactly what’s around us, inside us, and always under our feet. But recent advances in a field called metagenomics allow us to extract genetic “fingerprints” of microorganisms that we can’t otherwise track, and to shepherd a new understanding of the value of microorganisms, rather than an interest in eliminating them.

 Subculture: Microbial Metrics and the Multi-Species City, uses this new understanding to reframe the value of the urban landscape around us and flips the notion of a “healthy” city on its sterile head. An active metagenomic sequencing laboratory in Storefront’s gallery space will explore the invisible ecologies of our built environment, provoking deeper analysis of the character and evolution of the abundant genetic landscape of our cities.

 The installation in the gallery space, along with the scientific analysis of various sites across the city, gives us a model to broaden our realm of inquiry, pushing for greater resilience, diversity, and responsiveness of the urban fabric, and arguing that the collective future is a lot more collective than any of us can see or imagine.

Guadalupe Rosales has been building an archive of vernacular photographs and ephemera connected to Latinx culture in Los Angeles. Her projects exist as both archives of physical objects and crowdsourced digital archives, assembled on her widely followed Instagram accounts, Veteranas &amp; Rucas and Map Pointz. Guided by an instinct to create counternarratives, Rosales tells the stories of communities often underrepresented in official archives and public memory.

 Rosales views her work as a way of decriminalizing and reframing the history of brown youth, as well as connecting and reconstituting community. “I was always attracted to photographs not just for their images, but also for the notes written on the back. They were like relics; they reconnected me.” For this exhibition, which extends from a feature in Aperture’s Fall 2018 issue, “Los Angeles,” Rosales presents an installation of materials from her archives—from photobooth images of couples to young Chicanx women posing with cars to the party crews that ran East LA’s underground music scene in the 1990s.

 Guadalupe Rosales is an artist and archivist based in Los Angeles. She is founder and operator of Veteranas &amp; Rucas and Map Pointz, digital archives accessible through Instagram. Her work has been featured in exhibitions at the Vincent Price Art Museum, Monterey Park, California; Commonwealth and Council, Los Angeles; Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts, Omaha; and the Museum of Contemporary Art North Miami. In 2016, Rosales took over the New Yorker’s social media for a week and was one of the top-rated takeovers of the year. Her subsequent role as the inaugural Instagram Artist in Residence at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art was featured in the Los Angeles Times, Artsy, and Artforum. She has lectured at numerous museums and academic institutions, including the University of California, Los Angeles; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles; New Museum, New York; New York University; and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, among others. She received an MFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2016.

Steven Kasher Gallery presents Fred W. McDarrah: New York Scenes. The exhibition features 100 vintage black and white prints that span the late 1950s to the mid-1970s. The show features McDarrah’s most iconic images alongside never-before-seen work from his extensive archive. The exhibition launches the publication of the most comprehensive survey on the photographer, Fred W. McDarrah: New York Scenes, published by Abrams, which includes more than 270 illustrations and an introductory essay by Sean Wilentz. This is the gallery’s fourth solo exhibition of McDarrah’s work.

 The work of Fred W. McDarrah is having a massive resurgence. In addition to our exhibition and the new monograph, a solo exhibition Into the Artist’s World: Photographs by Fred W. McDarrah will open at the Parrish Art Museum in November 2018. Three additional solo exhibitions will open in 2018: Fred W. McDarrah as Mentor at Howl! Arts, New York; Fred W. McDarrah: Imaging The Living Theater, 1968 at the Alchemical Theater Co., New York; and The Beat Generation: Photographs by Fred W. McDarrah at the Beat Museum, San Francisco.

 Fred W. McDarrah (1926 - 2007) was the only staff photographer at The Village Voice for decades and was its first picture editor. McDarrah was the eyes of The Voice. His pictures were the graphic expression of the United States’ first, largest and most spirited alternative weekly as it recorded — and helped create — the most vibrant decades of the greatest city in the world. Through the medium of The Voice many of his images are lodged in our collective memories of bohemia and the counterculture. He covered New York City’s diverse downtown scenes, producing an unmatched and encyclopedic visual record of people, movements, and events. McDarrah frequented the bars, cafés, and galleries where writers, artists, and musicians gathered, and he was welcome in the apartments and lofts of the city’s avant-garde cultural aristocracy. He captured every vital moment, from Jack Kerouac reading poetry to Bob Dylan hanging out in Sheridan Square to Andy Warhol filming in the Factory, to the Stonewall rebellion.

 Celebrated historian Sean Wilentz vividly describes how McDarrah recorded the transformation of Greenwich Village from a local bohemian scene into a worldwide movement. “Fred left behind an unprecedented body of work from inside that movable site as it existed in mid-century Greenwich Village, when, for a while anyway, it shook the nation and the world. Nobody had ever come close to depicting what Fred did, and any future bohemian chronicle is bound to be shot differently from the way Fred did it. He was in the right place at the right time, and when the chance came for him to make the most of it, he didn’t blow it. So as long as there are those who will pay attention, Fred W. McDarrah’s spirit, the spirit inside these pictures, will tell its magical stories.”

 Born in Brooklyn, McDarrah bought his first camera at the 1939 World’s Fair in New York City. He served as a U.S. Army paratrooper in Occupied Japan at the end of World War II, camera usually in hand, and then earned a Journalism degree from New York University on the G.I. Bill. When a neighbor, Dan Fancher, told McDarrah that he and Norman Mailer were starting a newspaper to be called The Village Voice, McDarrah signed on. He was associated with the paper for the rest of his life.

 Fred W. McDarrah’s photographs have been exhibited at numerous museums, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of Art, the Albright–Knox Art Gallery, and the Centre Georges Pompidou. His work is found in numerous private and public collections including the Museum of Modern Art, National Portrait Gallery, the J. Paul Getty Museum, The National Gallery of Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. He was the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1972.

 McDarrah’s previous books include The Beat Scene (1960), The Artist’s World in Pictures (1961), Greenwich Village Guide (1963), New York, New York (1964), Kerouac and Friends: A Beat Generation Album (1985), Gay Pride: Photos from Stonewall to Today (1994), Beat Generation: Glory Days in Greenwich Village (1996), New York Stories (2001), Anarchy Protest and Rebellion &amp; The Counterculture That Changed America (2003), and Artists and Writers of the 60s and 70s (2006).

Sundaram Tagore Madison Ave. presents new and recent work by American artist Joan Vennum, best known for her lush, atmospheric paintings depicting the illusion of limitless space, as it appears both in her imagination and the natural world.

 For this show, the New York-based artist is presenting a series of oil-on-canvas paintings that are at once abstract and figurative, comprising luminous gradated color fields shaped by layers of meditative, rhythmic brushstrokes. With these new works, Vennum captures nature’s mutable atmospheric conditions, while refining her subject matter to its simplest form.

 Much of Vennum’s work is inspired by her travels and her observations of daily life, such as the sun setting on the river Ganges in India or the impact of weather on Sicily’s coastal landscape, the elements on the horizon and the spectacle of the sea. The dynamism of these elements and the vastness of space are made present in Vennum’s images through a combination of basic forms and intense surface detail.

 Vennum’s brushwork varies from open and soft, as with Four Through Time, where sky blue seamlessly shifts into bright coral, to stronger, more delineated strokes, as in the Wandering series, which vibrate with barely contained energy.

 Other Atmospheres 1, 2015, oil on canvas, 29 x 24 inches/73.6 x 61 cm

 Vennum’s rich palette spans nature’s full color spectrum, from vibrant vermillion and saffron yellow, to deep sea blues and earthy burgundies. Many of the works have at least one horizon line or possibly a hidden circle, though they don’t always reveal themselves at first glance. Vennum’s handling of paint has shifted toward a looser application over time and she has amplified the contrast between dark and light.

 Aside from careful measurements to determine the ratios of her color fields, her work is built from influences of the weather, recent visual experience and discovery within the painting itself. The resulting canvasses are both lively and ethereal. “I work like an Abstract Expressionist. It’s a discovery, step by step. It’s also a meditation, a combination of intention and meditation. I try to clear my mind when I paint, so that eventually the painting will realize itself.”

 Joan Vennum is a native of New York. She studied art in the 1950s at the University of Illinois with Abe Rattner and at Washington University with Abstract Expressionist Paul Burlin, who was a strong influence. Inspiration has also come from painters Piero della Francesca, Diego Velazquez and Philip Guston. Vennum is married to the painter Ted Kurahara.

 Vennum has exhibited widely in the United States and Sweden. Her work is in the permanent collections of the Brooklyn Museum; The Power Collection of Contemporary Art, Sydney; the Konstmuseet, Uttersberg, Sweden; the Skandia Försäkringsbolag, Stockholm; and the Museo Civico, Taverna, Italy.

The prolific collage work that John Ashbery produced over the last decade of his life is remarkable because it allows new insights into the creative process of one of America’s most reticent poets. But what many saw as a poet’s late foray into the visual arts was, in reality, a return to an early vocation that somehow morphed into complex hybrids. Composition, whether with images or words, was Ashbery’s métier and collage had been his technique of choice since the beginning of his career as a poet. The mixing of visual arts and literature was also a distinctive trait in the works of authors that have been of central interest to Ashbery, namely French writer Raymond Roussel, and American outsider artist Henry Darger. Ashbery, like Roussel and Darger, conveyed narrative through the juxtaposition of seemingly random imagery that left to the reader the task of filling the gaps and making connections.

 Presenting over one hundred and twenty collages and archival material, John Ashbery: The Construction of Fiction is the most comprehensive exhibition of Ashbery’s visual art to date. The exhibition will be accompanied by a fully illustrated catalog and public programs.

Drawing on Arabic semiotics and dwelling on calligraphy as a means of interpretive transcendence, Koraïchi’s work utilizes letters and signage to evoke figurative imagery and enumerate universal messages to a global audience. The current exhibition is comprised of three bodies of work centered around the mythological cosmology of the seven stations of heaven - a construct that permeates through cultures both East and West. Seen through the prism of Sufism, these represent the seven stages or maqaam that the soul must traverse in its search for enlightenment.

 Based in France and working across the world, Koraïchi has held several solo exhibitions, participated in numerous group exhibitions and publicly commissioned projects and is widely recognized as a pioneer of Islamic contemporary art and an important and influential artist, with a career spanning five decades

Franklin Parrasch Gallery presents Peter Alexander: Recent Work, the gallery’s sixth solo exhibition with the artist. A fully illustrated catalogue, including a new essay written by Alex Kitnick, accompanies the show.

 The works exhibited, dating from 2016 to present, represent a continuation of Alexander’s decades-long exploration of the perceptual limits of space and light through volume and color. As he continues to employ forms both beholden and unbound to the wall, Alexander invents new modes of interpreting these qualities. Leaners and wedges imitate architectonic elements at a human scale, testing perceptual capacity as the volumes emerge and recede in space and visibility. The artist’s wall-based bar works—such as Al Fresco (2018), Not On My Watch (2018), and Peaches n Cream (2018)—are slightly chatoyant and seem to radiate light, resulting in a dynamic vibrancy contrasting their static support. Alexander’s wedge-like or cubic forms, which he refers to as “rooms” or “quiet places to go,” encourage viewers to consider the possibilities of interior space as it relates to volume, color, and transparency.

 Peter Alexander (b. 1939) has been widely exhibited in galleries and institutions worldwide since the mid-1960s. His work resides in the permanent collections of such museums as the Museum of Modern Art (New York), National Gallery of Art (Washington, D.C.), the Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York), San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (New York).

<![CDATA[
“The accumulated Mexican cultural heritage is revealed in intense and sublime characteristics in the photographic works of Lola Alvarez Bravo and Mariana Yampolsky, masters of the use of photography to express the human and visual sides of Mexican culture.”
 —Spencer Throckmorton

 Essay author GRACIELA KARTOFEL will give a talk on the subject Saturday October 13 at 3pm at Throckmorton 145 East 57th Street.

 Throckmorton Fine Art presents a ‘visual dialogue’ between two master photographers whose attraction to Mexico’s diverse cultures sparked a unique bond between them during the decades of their friendship.
 Born a quarter century apart, Lola Alvarez Bravo in Mexico in 1903 (or 1907 by some accounts) and Mariana Yampolsky in Chicago in 1925, each used their photographic talents to portray human reality in ways that reflected their response to the indigenous cultures and people they met during many trips through Mexico. Unlike the works of esteemed artists such as Diego Rivera, Hugo Brehme, Claude-Joseph-Desire Charnay, Guillermo Kahlo, Edward Weston and Tina Modotti, who often portrayed political messages in their work, Lola and Mariana shared an affinity for and empathy with Mexican peasantry, shooting spontaneously and with great respect at a time when Mexico was just coming out of a revolution and experiencing rapid growth.

 Spencer Throckmorton says, “Lola and Mariana came from very different worlds. At times Lola functioned as Mariana’s mentor or teacher. Their shared love of Mexico and Mexican culture forged a friendship that lasted a lifetime.”

 Lola, born Delores Martinez de Anda in Jalisco, was orphaned at a young age, winding up with an older brother in Mexico City. She married her long-time friend, the renowned artist Manuel Alvarez Bravo, in 1925. Each was a self-taught photographer. Lola not only assisted Manuel with lab work but also opened a gallery in Mexico City, where both became acquainted with the artists of the time, among them Maria Izquierdo, Lupe Marin, Diego Rivera, and Rufino Tamayo. As her talents developed, Lola experimented with photomontage and cinematography. Her only short film, “Chapingo,” deals with Diego Rivera’s murals al fresco technique in Chapingo’s chapel, which deeply touched Lola, as did the cinematography medium itself.

 Lola Alvarez Bravo did a great number of portraits and also complete body figures. At some point the elegance and the surreal Mexican atmosphere became one in the photographs she took of women in reclining diagonal positions. This is seen in one of the most renowned photographs, of Isabel Villasenor, “The Dream” of 1941. Villasenor was a painter, actress and poet and married to the painter Gabriel Fernandez Ledesma.

 Olga Tamayo’s portrait in the 1940s has a similar interest in breaking the central and classical composition. Lola also photographed men asleep, in “Laziness,” and in “Asleep (under the truck).” One of her most famous portraits is of Frida Kahlo, the Mexican artist, dressed in black with the windowed mirror and the escuincles, her two little dogs, circa 1944. For Lola the portraits were to capture the physiognomic signs and the distinctive expressions, as in a three-quarter profile of Maria Izguierdo, 1940, and a face in complete profile in “Alfa Henestrosa,” 1950. Her Francisco Toledo image from the 1970s/80s is a symbolic photograph, one that goes far more than registering face signs of the master artist. The body frontal with a subtle inclination towards the right of the viewer creates a “X” with the head towards the left. Such a confrontation reveals his intense personality, and the dominant power he has as a world-renowned artist, and a local leader.

 In Throckmorton’s “Visual Dialogue” between Mariana’s and Lola’s photographs, Mariana also approaches non-frontal interesting angles in “The Bread, Mexico” 1992. The man is presenting the bread and holding the basket in a daily scene. Three vertical elements: both walls and the man, create the balance with the symbolic horizontal and oval container. Food, survival, for the buyer and the seller, are framed by rich textures in a light and shadow image. A similar composition of the areas dividing the photo is in “Morning Breakfast,” of 1984. It is a highly reproduced work by Yampolsky with an unusual distant scene.

 “Dancer with Bicycle” 1991 is a presentation of opposite elements, the indigenous traditional dress and mask, and the unstable transportation vehicle, meaning past and present time together. “Caricia/Caress” 1989 although not a self-portrait of Yampolsky, reveals her deep tenderness and love for the indigenous people of Mexico. This image is an intense contrasted light and shadow baroque result, one of those that doesn’t happen every day. If “Caress” signifies a natural attempt to register love, “The Beast,” 1988 expresses the opposite, the ferocious animal activity in contrasted dark environment, and inhabited by tensioned texture.

 Mariana Yampolsky was born in Chicago in 1925 to parents who had escaped from Europe and the Nazis. Her Russian emigre father Oscar was a sculptor and painter. Mariana was raised on her paternal grandparent’s farm. Her mother, Hedwig Urbach, came from the well-off intellectual family of a pioneer in Modern Anthropology, Franz Boas, who decisively influenced Mariana.

 In 1944, after graduating from the University of Chicago, Mariana heard about the Mexican muralist movement in a lecture she attended and made the decision to travel to Mexico. Although she spoke no Spanish she immersed herself in Mexican culture and its people. Through meetings with Pablo O’Higgins and Leopoldo Mendez she began to work at a printer’s space mostly devoted to labor unions and farmers. Her contact with the Popular Print Workshop or People’s Graphics Workshop (TGP), where she was the only woman at the time, put her in touch with accomplished artists who did prints, drawings, and paintings. Mariana remained active in the TGP from 1945 to 1960 and was a significant contributor as secretary, printer and exhibition organizer – plus doing her own prints. Her prints were powerful semi-abstract references to her political/social ideas.

 TGP artists worked quickly, didn’t number their prints, and sometimes forgot to sign their works. They also charged very little, many times giving their artwork for free to workers and social activists.

 Soon after Mariana left the TGP she was hired as the photographer for a two-volume book The Ephemeral and the Eternal in Mexican Popular Art. Her career evolved, and she found herself working in photography, prints, editorial, organizing exhibitions and writing.

 Mariana’s photography focuses on the architecture of rural Mexico and the faded majesty of Mexico’s colonial plantations. Her images of poverty-stricken peasants and the wives and mothers whose husbands have left them to find work in the cites, share a quality of timelessness and a tenacity with which history and traditions survive in contemporary Mexican life.

 Two prints by Mariana and Lola have much in common, although with a time difference of sixteen years. The pair of images could be called ‘women by women’. They involve two models and two authors, but there was no call of feminist concerns. Women were hard workers, carrying and passing on their traditions. “Yalalag. Oaxaca” 1946 by Lola Alvarez Bravo is a gelatin silver print using a diagonal composition but articulating triangles and rectangles in baroque contrasts. Thematically, here is a standing woman displaying the goods of Oaxacan women’s clothing. The photo doesn’t refer poverty but the woman with her hand on her face insinuates concerns, things she is preoccupied with. No doubt the situation deals with the singular and the plural, meaning with herself and with the indigenous people that then and still now are not respected, not protected.

 “Covering Huipil,” 1962 by Mariana Yampolsky is also an image taken in Oaxaca. This vintage gelatin silver print is one of Mariana’s most well-known pieces – a complex composition one can say, a battle of forces – between light and shadow. The shoeless woman walks. From the feet up, she seems to be a dark column until the huipil blows away from her body creating a volumetric thing, like an opened bird wing. On the side, almost opposed to her, is a dark vertically diagonal column with complex bits and pieces. It is a shadow that part of the construction ceiling projects on the light external wall. “Covering Huipil” is a constant confrontation of opposite pairs of light and shadow, even the way the mountains and sky are pictured.

 Both Lola and Mariana had naturally accumulated heritage. Both managed ways to inherit it. Each accessed this heritage with their creative spirit, freedom, personal curiosity, respect and good humor. Together they understood that photography is a medium with no end.

 Spencer Throckmorton founded Throckmorton Fine Art in 1980 and maintains a high-profile gallery in New York City’s East 57th Street art district that has become one of the foremost sources for important Latin American Contemporary and Vintage Photography as well as Chinese Jade and Asian antiquities, and pre-Columbian art. The gallery participates in internationally acclaimed fairs, including more than 30 years exhibiting at the prestigious Winter Antiques Show in New York; the Association of International Photography Art Dealers (AIPAD) Photography Show each April, and it stages important annual exhibitions in the spring during Asia Week. It has also published more than a dozen catalogs on these subjects. Demonstrating the gallery’s commitment to connoisseurship, Throckmorton has achieved sales to such major museums as The Museum of Modern Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Getty and The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, as well as The Reina Sofia in Madrid. Portions of collections the gallery was instrumental in forming have been donated to The Louvre. The gallery loans examples on a regular basis to such significant institutions as The London National Gallery.

<![CDATA[
What does painting specifically “do”? Painting has been a mode of public expression for many systems of culture and politics, and as Theodor Adorno noted, painting contains sedimented time. It is a slow medium, unfolding as it works on and with the viewer. The material of paint is itself a language that, because of its specific materiality, proportion, and location, creates friction. In the contemporary moment when all images seem recognizable, painting stands out from the digital realm. Painting is a site where viewers may experiment with piecing together constellations of meaning from fragments. In today’s visual culture, such a practice of precise looking and questioning is “disobedient,” in the words of Robert Duncan’s poem “The Law.” Examining a painting offers a valuable slice of time to wrestle with what we assume we know about visual language and to question what we take for granted in making meaning.

 The exhibition and related programs “Disobedience is Not Careless” with painter Jen Mazza explores language and quotation through painting, philosophy and poetry, curated by Katherine Carl.

Brancusi &amp; Duchamp: The Art of Dialogue, curated by art historian Paul B. Franklin, explores the aesthetic dialogue between Constantin Brancusi (1876–1957) and Marcel Duchamp (1887–1968), two of the most inimitable and innovative artists of the twentieth century. Bringing together over 90 paintings, sculptures, photographs, films and drawings from an international array of public and private collections, as well as a selection of rare archival documents, this exhibition is the first of its kind in any American museum or gallery. Brancusi &amp; Duchamp: The Art of Dialogue aims to enrich our knowledge of the personal and creative conversation that sustained these two utterly singular artists for years.

On Adornment is a group exhibition, curated by Jenn Hampton featuring emerging and mid-career artists who create works that challenge and destabilize conventional thinking on the term ‘adornment’. Through the exhibition, concepts of adornment — particularly in the context of female imaging and agency — are unpacked, explored, and reimagined in new contemporary ways. Works selected lull viewers in and compel a reaction with traditional aesthetics and recognizable, if not familiar, scenes that are systematically subverted by the introduction of new techniques and a depth of meaning, effectively corrupting what we once thought. Finally, these works reveal nuanced interpretations that reflect on liberation juxtaposed to, or as part of, one’s adornment of oneself.

 On Adornment features work by the following twenty-two artists: Carrie Ann Baade, Alison Brady, Bri Cirel, Katherine Cooksey, Rose Deler, Natalia Fabia, Rose Freymuth-Frazier, Ellen Green, Jan Huling, Julia Ibbini, Katelyn Kopenhaver, Koralie, Joanne Leah, Aleya Lehmann, Michela Martello, Felicita Maynard, Rowan Renee, Jill Ricci, Annina Roescheisen, Rebecca Rose, Ellen Stagg, and Aleksandra Stone.

Pablo’s Birthday presents the artist Galeno in collaboration with his Brazilian gallery Karla Osorio. This exhibition represents the artist’s first solo gallery show in the United States and brings together a consistent and mature production.

 Born in the north of Brazil (Piauí/ Parnaíba), Galeno lived, studied, and worked most of his life in Brasília. Three years ago moving back to his origins in his birthplace region, the artist deepened his research, enriching it with new meanings and an increasingly broad universe from paintings to sculptures and objects. He creates a new and original geometry, influenced by ancestral elements, connected to his own history. The show proposes a panorama of more recent works with a few historical pieces.

 Galeno is a leading Brazilian artist born in Delta do Parnaíba, Piauí (1957) and living between Brasília and Parnaíba. He studied visual arts at the University of Brasília (UNB). Using several techniques such as painting, drawings, engraving, fresco, sculpture and installation, he is one of the most active Brazilian artists. He chose his solitude in the last years to concentrate even more in his production.

 Mainly influenced by Brazilian Constructivism and geometry, his work constantly fluctuates between figurative and abstract elements in an interpretive exercise. Through his unique treatment of color and sophisticate compositions, he establishes a rhythm, constructing a vibrant universe. Contemporary, but strongly attached to his personal history, he turns his subjective experience into universal themes through a poetic symbology. He incorporates unexpected and innovative elements, retracing in an erudite way his artistic path. Among his main subjects are trivial objects such as: reels, lamps, keyholes, chameleons, fragments of a modern architecture, river boats, saints and reliquaries, which all together become part of a new vocabulary. Art and life are merged, telling a story, sharing a past, generating a new future in art. Galeno has participated in numerous group and solo exhibitions in Brazil and abroad, mainly in Europe. There are several texts and publications on his work. He has won several awards such as Acquisition Prize, including for residences abroad. In 2012 he was chosen by the IPHAN/MinC as the author of the Our Lady of Fatima church’s great panel, in Brasília, succeeding the great Italian-Brazilian painter Alfredo Volpi. He participated at Bienal do Mercosul 2015. His works are in several private and public collections in Brazil and abroad, including Museu de Arte do Rio, Museu de Arte Moderna in Rio de Janeiro, among others.

 According to curator Marco Antonio Vieira, Galeno’s works seems to “gravitate around the objects picked by his desire as a painter. An encounter of intense colorations in which the figurative elements abandon their anchorage in the scene which would contextualize them to appear as quasi-phantasmatic signs, so as to hint at a chain which denotes dislocation and reiterates a symptomal picture in which the same appears altered yet insistent. There would be, therefore, something tantamount to a structure, which takes on the form of a signature herein. It is within this framework that Galeno is seen.

 “…he will display six new paintings; they are still prisons and conduits, but now Halley has mashed his canvases together to form ungainly new shapes, as though his cells are staging a jail break. Inside are three rooms wallpapered in a smorgasbord of signature motifs: Halley’s ’80s sketchbook drawings, digitally printed onto a radioactive-looking yellow backdrop; images of gooey cartoon explosions, displayed under color-shifting LEDS; a mesmerizing blue matrix of cells that glow like computer screens beneath a “pseudo-mystical” black light.”

Nao Bustamante, Billy X. Curmano, Irina Danilova &amp; Project 59, Beatrice Glow, Ivan Monforte, Linda Mary Montano, Praxis (Delia &amp; Brainard Carey), Elizabeth Stephens &amp; Annie Sprinkle, and Martha Wilson &amp; Franklin Furnace Archive

 Curated by: Nicolás Dumit Estévez Raful
 Curatorial Fellow: JP-Anne Giera

 EFA Project Space presents As Far as the Heart Can See, an exhibition that brings together art and everyday life through performative acts of care, transgression, and multigenerational collaboration. The exhibition marks the start of EFA Project Space’s 10th anniversary season.

 Curated by Nicolás Dumit Estévez Raful—whose elusive creative path embodies intimacy, healing, empathy, and radical generosity—As Far as the Heart Can See focuses on figures who parry institutional canons and over-professionalization to pursue art as a call to the heart. In the words of Linda Mary Montano, this is art that “gives one permission to…”

 Artists fatigued by pressure to both make and “be” objects, take note – As Far as the Heart Can See assembles those who have shifted gear, broken away, found shelter in the wilderness, or ventured astray from art-historical validation in order to speak truth. Many of those in As Far as the Heart Can See refer to what they do as a ‘vocation,’ suggesting bold acts and a readiness to trade normative success for something more. These artists have expanded their own fields and have pushed one to rethink disciplines such as ecology, thanatology, gender studies, anthropology, and social work.

 Nao Bustamante’s sculptures and photographs mixes the beautiful with the grotesque: duct tape, shadow-play, and boxed wine provide a material basis for an existential exploration of human desire – natural and contrived. Martha Wilson embodies a prophetic discourse, from her body transformations of the 1970s to her ongoing series of impersonations of U.S. dignitaries, including Michelle Obama, Barbara Bush, and Bill Clinton. Wilson’s lifework, Franklin Furnace, is an iconoclastic arts organization whose mission “to make the world safe for avant-garde art” has propelled the practices of hundreds of artists since 1976. Billy X. Curmano’s performances are at once modest and extreme: for instance, a ten-year-long performance in which he swam, lap by lap, the length of the Mississippi River, or the three days spent buried alive in order to perform for the dead. Elizabeth Stephens and Annie Sprinkle meld sexuality and ecology into SexEcology (or Ecosexuality), such as in their Ecosex Weddings series, in which the duo weds soil, snow, the mountains and sea in environmental ardour.

 Linda Mary Montano serves as a central figure in the exhibition: over her career she has cared for her elder father as art, performed blessings as Saint Teresa of Calcutta, and declared her body to be a living sculpture, chiseled by time. Montano’s performance video, NURSE! NURSE! (2016) leads us through a rehearsal of being cared for, and compels us to shout aloud the work’s title. Likewise, Ivan Monforte encourages affect within the gallery’s controlled emotional context with There But For The Grace Of God Go I, in which he partners with Gay Men’s Health Crisis to facilitate free and confidential HIV screenings and referrals to gallery-goers. Beatrice Glow traverses anthropology, ethnography, botany, and archeology to awaken latent imaginaries. Her film, Taparaco Myth (2009), unfolds as a journey through urban and rural South America to trace the migratory route of an Asian immigrant, El Chino. Ukrainian-born Irina Danilova’s move to New York in 1994 led to the creation of a random number-based project, Project 59, which manifests as a compilation of poems from page 59 of popular poetry collections, dinners prepared from recipes found on page 59 of different cookbooks, and a climbing plant that proclaims “59” on the gallery’s wall. Praxis’ (Delia &amp; Brainard Carey) interventions comprise an unusual inventory of strategies, substances, and rituals, such as a long-distance prayer through the Internet and Band-Aids for invisible wounds. The exhibition features documentation of Forget Me Not (2004), which tells the story of Brainard Carey’s mother’s death and burial in two parts: “Tools for the Living” and “Tools for the Dying.”

 Highlighting ongoing and durational work, the exhibition also features performance documentation, ephemera, manifestos, interviews, and artist proposals culled from nearly 20 years of the Franklin Furnace Fund for Performance Art serving as a testament to the transient and intransigent lifework of cultural producers.

 Launched in September 2008, EFA Project Space was founded on the belief that art is intrinsically tied to the individuals who produce it, the communities that arise because of it, and to everyday life. For our 10-year anniversary, we have assembled an exhibition of artists who give permission to operate astride genres, enact manifestos, rethink disciplines, initiate mentorship, nurture community, and redefine civic engagement. As Far as the Heart Can See asks us to roll up our sleeves and pursue our calling.

 Nicolás Dumit Estévez Raful’s treads an elusive path that manifests itself performatively or through experienceswhere the quotidian and art overlap. He has exhibited and performed extensively in the U.S. as well as internationally. Residencies attended include P.S. 1/MoMA, Yaddo, Center for Book Arts, and the MacDowell Colony. Estévez Raful Holds an MFA from Tyler School of Art, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, where he studied with Coco Fusco; and an MA from Union Theological Seminary. He has received mentorship in art in everyday life from Linda Mary Montano, a historic figure in the performance art field. Montano and Estévez Raful have also collaborated on several performances. Publications include Pleased to Meet You, One Person at a Time, Life as Material for Art and Vice Versa (editor), and For Art’s Sake. He has curated exhibitions and programs for El Museo del Barrio; the Institute for Art, Religion and Social Justice at Union Theological Seminary; Art in Odd Places; Cuchifritos; the Center for Book Arts; and Longwood Art Gallery/Bronx Council on the Arts, New York; and for the Filmoteca de Andalucía, Córdoba, Spain. Estévez Raful is the founding director of The Mangú Museum (pronounced man-goo). He was born in Santiago de los Treinta Caballeros, Dominican Republic. In 2011, he was baptized as a Bronxite; a citizen of the Bronx.

 JP-Anne Judy Giera is an interdisciplinary artist and curator. Classically trained as an actor, they hold an MFA in Theatre from the prestigious Actors Studio Drama School at Pace University, however their work began to move towards visual art during the year they spent studying at Pratt Institute. JP-Anne’s art interest exists at the praxis of painting and performance. Their work output includes, but isn’t limited to, painting, drawing, performance, video, zines, printmaking and installation, but seemingly exists betwixt and between all of these media, much as their identity as a transgender non-binary identified person exists betwixt and between common cultural norms regarding gender, sexuality, and appearance. As an artist, their work has been exhibited throughout the New York City area. As a curator, JP-Anne has curated projects for the LGBT Community Center and SAGE (Services and Advocacy for GLBT Elders). They served as the 2017 Curatorial Intern at White Columns and are the current Curatorial Fellow at the Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts Project Space. JP-Anne is pursuing an MFA in Art at Lehman College/CUNY. Her studio is in the Bronx and she resides in Crown Heights, Brooklyn with her two cats.

Larrie presents Absent Without Leave, a solo exhibition by New York artist Camilla Deterre. Absent Without Leave centers on the physical erosion of the presence of childhood in the urban environment. With this exhibition, Deterre draws attention to the importance of play, its erasure from the urban landscape and the need to preserve public space, in particular, playscapes, from commercial development. With the widespread removal of seesaws from New York’s playgrounds, so goes action, adventure, understanding and the hidden rewards and dangers of the physical world.

 In Absent Without Leave, Deterre revisits New York City playscapes and questions the role of play in restoring her own childhood through performed actions as a means of shared catharsis. Deterre’s sculptures abstract and preserve through undefined forms made from negative space. By wrapping portions of pre-existing frameworks designated as public playgrounds, Deterre’s sculptures at once conceal and preserve this conceptually contested space through sculptural abstraction.

 Absent Without Leave includes photographic prints that serve as both documentation of these performed actions and as placeholders for the sculptures’ inevitable deterioration or removal. Also included is Deterre’s Seesaw that serves as a symbolic reminder of the principle understanding of play as the root of what has been lost, erased and replaced in the city’s landscape.

Curated By Nitza Tufiño

 Carlos Ivan Molina’s first NYC exhibition includes images of individuals who have inspired this artist to honor political/historical heroes of his beloved Colombia as well as those who have brought joy, music and mirth to his life. Molina’s use of vibrant colors in different renditions, explode before the viewer and present the challenge to decide which is the favorite?. He modernizes the historical and celebrates the pop. He plays with his icons while holding a serious conversation with them concerning the present state of affairs here in the U.S. and Colombia. He lovingly embraces his icons and projects a wistful attitude in the selection of their colors. Viewed thoughtfully, you will agree that it is “ICONtastic”!
 -Nitza Tufiño, Curator

<![CDATA[
To lift yourself out of a miserable state— even by vigorous force— should be easy. I tear myself off the chair, stride around the table, exercise my head and neck, bring fire to my eyes, flex the muscles around them. Defy any emotion, I would welcome A. enthusiastically, if he comes to see me now; amiably tolerate B., swallow in long draughts everything that is said at C.’s, despite the pain and trouble. But even if that were to happen, one mistake, that is unavoidable, will stop it all, light and heavy alike, it will withdraw around and around in a circle.

 Hence, the best advice is to endure all, to make yourself an inert mass, even that you feel, you are a leaf in the wind, to regard your fellow man with an animal gaze, to feel no compunction, in short with your own hands to throttle down any remnant of life— that ghostly remains in you, that is, to increase the final peace, the grave-like rest, and let nothing exist but that.

 A characteristic gesture in such a state is to run your little finger over your eyebrows.

San Francisco-based curator Betti-Sue Hertz, a former Executive Director of BRAC, is the guest curator.

 Persona considers how the confluence of social culture, digital imaging, and political insecurity is contributing to the fluidity of identity and generating new strategies for managing public personas. The exhibition explores intersections of cultural, racial and ethnic formation as foundations for negotiating identity in material and virtual realities.

 Participating artists: Morehshin Allahyari, Zach Blas, David Antonio Cruz, Heather Dewey-Hagborg, Amaryllis DeJesus Moleski, and Hrvoje Slovenc

 Morehshin Allahyari’s digital animations explore various dark goddesses-monstrous and jinn female figures-from Middle Eastern mythologies.
 Zach Blas invents an amorphous mask as one way to avoid being surveilled by facial recognition techniques, and considers its function in relationship to masks used by those engaged in resistance movements.

 David Antonio Cruz’s paintings of black and brown queer bodies-solo and in couples- are informed by issues on visibility and camp theatricality.
 For the 3D printed masks in Stranger Visions, Heather Dewey-Hagborg collected random items from public places in New York City and imagined the facial characteristics of their prior owners based on genomic research and DNA analysis.

 Amaryllis DeJesus Moleski’s futuristic paintings feature fanciful visualizations of mythological femme figures in quasi-narrative situations informed by queer and of color communities.
 Hrvoje Slovenc’s portrait project of men from one village reveals the personal toll of Croatia’s troubled past.

 In the 1990s, the digital sphere opened up new avenues for displaying and projecting complex identities. Virtual platforms provided a space for invention and experimentation-for creating imagined identities. One’s constructed persona-mutable and virtual-became accessible to wider audiences. This freedom of invention would also lead to fragmentation and segmentation with the virtual self, inserting itself into real-life struggles, fantasies of escape, and sexual desires. By the 2000s, while some artists embraced these new worlds of constructed personas, others became even more committed to representing the realities of everyday life by amplifying notions of the authentic self through the conventions of portraiture, a genre that prioritizes the likeness of a person as an expression of their interiority.

 Since its beginnings in the 1980s, Bronx River Art Center’s exhibitions have featured work by artists who question various socially embedded stereotypes and reject limited notions of race, gender, and sexuality. Persona: Presenting Authentic, Necessary and Constructed Selves continues this commitment, visually navigating the new vulnerabilities faced by individuals at a time when social and media environments as well as new technologies, have become ever more influential.

 Persona is the first of five exhibits that will take place during the art center’s inaugural year in its restored building, after an eight-year hiatus for its renovation. Collectively titled “Waypoints: Platforms for Renewal,” the series of exhibitions are designed to bring core questions for the Bronx River Art Center into being by accessing nodes along its past trajectory. The intent is to situate the organization’s relationship to place-making and community building into a model for the future that reflects upon its development over three decades. Additional curators in the series include: BRAC’s current Executive Director, Gail Nathan, and two past Gallery Directors, Jose Ruiz and Chad Stayrook. BRAC’s next Gallery Director will curate a final exhibit in the series.

<![CDATA[
Gladstone Gallery presents an exhibition of three distinct yet interrelated bodies of work by Ugo Rondinone in both Chelsea locations. Developed throughout his practice, these large-scale landscape drawings, window, and sun sculptures speak directly to Rondinone’s continued exploration of German Romanticism and its key artistic figure, Caspar David Friedrich. Reanimating commonplace objects—such as tree branches or window frames—in his own Neo-Romantic signature, he creates a lyrical world of his own. This formal and generic diversity mines the fecund aesthetic and philosophical tensions central to his work: nature and humanity, exterior world and inner life, expansion and intimacy, organic and artificial. Rondinone stylizes these dichotomies into new physical and temporal sites of self-reflection and universal connection.

 Rondinone’s sepia drawings of wooded landscapes have been foundational to his oeuvre since 1989. Reminiscent of the drawings of Romantic landscape painters Rodolphe Bresdin and Samuel Palmer, the haptic idiosyncrasies of Rondinone’s hatching gestures manifest in absorbing tableau of knotted trees, twisting branches, and overabundant foliage. In this way, they extend the tradition of the wanderzeichner or wandering draughtsman—a sylvan progenitor to the urban flaneur—into the present day. Exchanging plein air realism for imaginative fiction, these large-scale drawings come from an archive of the artist’s own naturalist sketches of individual flora; they are then patchworked together into a world of Rondinone’s creation. Seducing the viewer into darkness, these drawings recall nature’s central role in the Romantic conception of the sublime. In his Theories of Garden Art (1775/77), noted German philosopher and landscape designer C.C.L. Hirschfeld presaged the soul expanding properties of such expansive and dramatic vistas: Rondinone’s beguiling landscapes, too, inspire one to feel that one “no longer belongs to the everyday, but instead is a being of power and determination manifesting far beyond the point at which we stand.”

 Gladstone’s 21st street location will feature a monumental sun sculpture, a single ring of gilded bronze, cast from encircling tree branches. Blunt ends of the individual tree trunks and the punctae of twigs bind the sun to the ground, even as it seems to hang in the air. Evoking the celestial body using antecedents of the earth, Rondinone’s sun celebrates the lyrical paradoxes that contour ontological boundaries and how they eventually collapse via the aesthetic gesture’s potential to transform. Both spaces include examples of his series of window sculptures—metal casts of nineteenth-century window casings each named for one of Friedrich’s paintings, including drifting clouds, where this exhibition takes its name. Defying the expectation of revealing a “heavenly panorama” of the kind writer Kurt Waller noted he saw in the views from Friedrich’s studio, the burnished opacity of these window panes marks a key distinction in Rondinone’s practice. For him, the shift between complete absorption in the natural world’s sublimity to the solitude of self-reflection hearkens to dramatic tensions that distinguish the Romantic mode, while also recalling nineteenth century critic Walter Pater’s evocation of sensual experience as ultimately “the impression of the individual in his isolation, each mind keeping as a solitary prisoner its own dream of a world.”

 Ugo Rondinone was born in 1964 in Brunnen, Switzerland and currently lives and works in New York. Rondinone has been the subject of recent solo exhibitions at institutions including: Bass Museum of Art, Miami; Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley; Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati; Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, Moscow; Place Vendôme, Paris; MACRO and Mercati di Traiano, Rome; The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston; Museum Boijmans van Beuningen, Rotterdam; Museum Anahuacalli, Mexico City; Rockbund Art Museum, Shanghai; Museum of Cycladic Art, Athens; Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien, Vienna; and Museum Dhondt-Dhaenens, Deurle, Belgium. In 2016, Rondinone’s large-scale public work seven magic mountains opened outside Las Vegas, co-produced by the Art Production Fund and Nevada Museum of Art. Last year, Rondinone curated a city-wide exhibition, “Ugo Rondinone: I ♥ John Giorno,” which honored the artist’s life partner in thirteen venues throughout Manhattan. His work is currently on view at the Arken Museum of Modern Art in Ishøj, Denmark through the end of the year.

ltural references—from sci-fi to modernism to Doc Martens to slave ships to Amazon’s factory floor—asking us to deeply consider society’s divisions and fractures, using the medium of sculpture to investigate the psychic technologies that enable them.

 This body of work continues Buckley’s investigation into historical, fictional, contemporary and speculative abuses that render people into “chattel, orcs, suspects, and clones.” His ongoing research into the sources and symbols of feudalism, racism and imperialism infuse the work. Central to Buckley’s practice is the use of “non-materials” —ideas, processes, people—manipulated in manners that mimic the archetypal languages and processes of sculpture.This lends itself to an ongoing critique and consideration of the mechanics of objectification, and the obverse of objectification: dehumanization.

 Traitor Muscle centers around a trio of new sculptures. Standing at 9-feet tall and 12-feet wide, Best Clone Sons are fitted with riot gloves and yellow teardrops that function as a symbol of performative grievance. Glass Aristocrat is an optically clear figure who wears a fine suit and sits upon a custom-made replica of a Roman Senatorial throne depicted throughout Neoclassical painting. Orcish Shelving System consists of 64 life-sized orcs stacked atop one another, a fictional humanoid race originating in the writings of J. R. R.Tolkien which has become a widespread archetype used across the genres of sci-fi and fantasy. In addition to these works, each surface of the exhibition space features installation elements, including a floor with bright red and green delineations to suggest the logic and layout of an automated factory floor and a poem by the artist inscribed onto the window, confronting the hegemony of the artworld’s whiteness.

 Here figurative sculpture’s art historical lineage is contrasted with up-to-the-minute materials, concerns and aesthetics. Visual references to medieval battle armor blend with forms from Star Wars and Warhammer. A genealogy of Doc Martens boot wearers from factory workers to skinheads to hipsters is recalled. Traitor Muscle points to obscured violences and mechanisms of exclusion everywhere embedded and naturalized in the world around us.The powerful and often unexpected combinations of references, symbols, histories and meanings employed by the artist give the work its striking resonance and allow it to speak clearly in speculative vernacular to real-world conditions.

 Joseph Buckley is black British artist of Irish and Caribbean extraction who was born in 1990 in Ellesmere Port, England and currently lives and works in Brooklyn, NewYork. Buckley studied at Leeds College of Art and Gold- smiths, University of London, graduating in 2010 and 2013 respectively. In 2013 he moved to the United States where he graduated from Yale School of Art in 2015.

 Welancora Gallery presents In the Future When…., works by Damien Davis, Delano Dunn, and Tiffany Smith.

 Organized by Daricia Mia DeMarr, the exhibition explores three distinctive views of the future presented in stark contrast to what might be expected given Ame

rica’s past and its present. Within this framework, the assemblages and installation on view examine notions of identity, representation and the intricacies of the African American experience.

 Damien Davis’ assemblages of plexiglass and mirrors blend references from Afrofuturism 2.0, and nine episodes from Star Trek Deep Space 9, which were starred in and directed by Avery Brooks, the first black captain in the Star Trek franchise, to explore notions of social science, metaphysics and cultural analytics as a means of promoting the contributions of black men.

 Through a combination of archival images, cellophane, glitter, vinyl and gold leaf on paper and board, Delano Dunn’s work engages the past to create an unimaginable journey into the future for the black slave character Jim, from Mark Twain’s novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.

 Tiffany Smith’s installation is a commentary on representation as reflected in her self-portraits, flora patterned wallpaper, plants, and other accents used to outfit her tropical patio scene. Smith’s environment is a window into her layered persona in past, present and future.

 Daricia Mia DeMarr is from Los Angeles, California. She launched her collegiate career at Clark Atlanta University but received a BA in Art History from Georgia State University and a master’s degree in Visual Arts Administration from New York University. She is currently an independent curator and arts administrator at the world’s largest airport with the Hartsfield-Jackson Art Program.

<![CDATA[
An exhibition of paintings and drawings celebrating the artist’s wife and muse Elena as subject. Their relationship, begun in the mid-1950s, inspired Will Barnet’s return to representational imagery and the development of his distinctive and iconic, simplified, hard-edged figurative style. Works included range in date from 1955 to 1999 and are gathered from the family’s private collection.

 “It is not an exaggeration to state that Barnet’s paintings of his second wife, Elena, constitute one of the high points of American art in the 1980s, a decade when slathered paint and showmanship had become the rage. Barnet’s portraits instead embody a quiet rebuke to excess and hyperbole. Working with flat shapes and a palette of muted colors, he was able to convey a most unlikely subject: the pleasure two people take in one another’s company.” (John Yau, 2018)

 “The love letters referred to in the exhibition title are, of course, the paintings, watercolors and drawings produced through the steady deepening of their marriage from passionate ardor to sustained devotion to quiet, caring fortitude at the very end. As a body of work, the exhibition celebrates that long, enduring embrace, one captured in the classical beauty, stillness and grace of Elena’s constant presence.” (Chris Crosman, 2018)

<![CDATA[
“My work focuses on reconnecting time. Time is an illusory and shapeless substance. It is homogeneous along its entire length, and we recognize each of its distinct ages by the objects it produces and leaves behind. Time is like a blank canvas on which each age leaves its own inimitable imprint, coloring it with its own recognizable objects. Our parents and grandparents, and generations that came before them were all defined by the objects of their age. We see them in old photographs dressed in the fashion of the day, sitting next to their record players or driving their quaint motor cars. The old photographs, the black-and-white images printed on cardboard from the century before last or the Polaroids from the 1970s, are also now a thing of the past - as are earlier oil portrait of men and women who came before them. It is the objects that pin us to the blank canvas of our time.

 I collect those objects, the images of the people they used to define and the ideas - in philosophy, technology, the arts - that gave rise to them, and put them in my work.

 I work in a variety of media. I make paintings, collages, sculpture, drawings, and ceramics. I scour flea markets looking for an old object, for machines, mechanisms, and devices of the past, whose purpose we no longer understand but that are ineluctably pinned to the age when they were created. They were once indispensable and useful, and they defined their time. I don’t try to restore or even understand them, but I find a new life for them in my work.

 Our own age is defined by the amazing variety of objects we have created, but even more so by the objects, we have discarded. This doesn’t mean that time has accelerated but rather that ages change one another at a kaleidoscopic pace, without having time to define themselves, to shape into an image or to leave a memory. I see my work as stringing together those half-formed shards of ages and reconnecting them into a continuous timeline.”

Curated by Sadia Shirazi, independent curator, writer and architect

 Lower East Side Printshop presents Three days in the desert guest curated by Sadia Shirazi.

 A modernist ruin sinks into a stream in Michelle Gevint’s digital composite print Untitled (Urban Speculation). Its curved form is mirrored by its reflection, creating a dystopic portal. Her aluminum prints appropriate photographs of urban sprawl to meditate on the aerial view, a technology of vision used by colonial states, urban planners and the military alike. Umber Majeed’s Hypersurface of the Present brings the failures of architectural modernism into conversation with postcoloniality and excess. Both the installation, and the hallucinogenic single-channel video In the Name of Hypersurface of the Present, playfully deconstruct processes of vision, nation-building and the digital and religious valences of the color green. Ethan Greenbaum’s diptych reproduces the repetition and layering found in the built environment in the artist’s own multi-layered printing process. Kaela Mei-Chee Chambers frames an architectural vignette of brightly hued, perspectivally receding archways that are inviting but impenetrable. Felix Plaza’s PANOPLIA-AUTORITRATTO-TELA BLU, a silkscreened cloth is populated with images ranging from du-rag packaging, to musical scores, mixing the purportedly “high” and “low” to create a self-portrait of the artist’s affinities with particular objects. Doug Collins’s etchings are softly rendered abstract landscapes, responses to translations of the poet Meng Hao-ran. Hannah Smith Allen superimposes chat bubbles and border walls onto pixellated photographs of the U.S.-Mexico border, evoking questions of discrimination and citizenship.

 *The exhibition title is drawn from Eduardo C. Corral’s poem “Border Triptych” (2012).

 Sadia Shirazi is an independent curator, writer and architect based in New York. Shirazi joined the Whitney Museum of American Art’s Independent Study Program (ISP) as the Instructor for Curatorial Studies in September 2018.

 Shirazi’s work has been shown internationally at the 16th Venice Architecture Biennale and Performance Space New York. Recent curatorial projects include welcome to what we took from is the state at The Queens Museum in New York (2016), and 230 MB / Exhibition Without Objects (EwO) at Khoj International Artists’ Association in New Delhi (2013). She is curating upcoming exhibitions at EFA project space in New York (2019) and a third iteration of the traveling Exhibition Without Objects in Karachi (2019).

 Shirazi is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Art History and Visual Studies at Cornell University and teaches at The New School in New York. She was a Helena Rubinstein curatorial fellow at the Whitney ISP, and an artist-in-residence at Clark House Initiative in Bombay and Yaddo in New York. Shirazi holds a BA from the University of Chicago and an MArch from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Peter Blum Gallery presents an exhibition of sculptural works by Joyce J. Scott entitled What Next and Why Not at 176 Grand Street, New York. This is the artist’s first solo show with the gallery.

 This exhibition will focus on works made since the year 2000, that bridge the gap between craft aesthetics and contemporary sculpture. The group of approximately 20 sculptures incorporates Scott’s trademark beadwork with, blown glass, found objects, and mixed-media. Scott’s visual lexicon integrates elements from a wide variety of cultures and spiritual traditions, including influences from her post graduate studies in Mexico, West African Yoruba weaving techniques, Native American and transcendent Buddhist belief systems, and perhaps most importantly, American Southern traditions of quilting, weaving, and beadwork which are deeply rooted in her own family history.

 The visual richness of the objects is held in stark contrast to the weight of the subject matter that they explore. The works dive deep into issues of class, race, gender, and violence, often mining history to better understand the present moment. The sculptures embed cultural critique within the pleasurable experience of viewing a pristinely crafted object. This dichotomy is at the center of Scott’s practice and this exhibition. The titles of the works provide an entry point into the narratives at play. For example, Sex Traffic 2, 2017, depicts a floating nude female figure made of dark brown/green blown glass, embraced by an intricately beaded white skeleton. In War Woman II, 2014, Scott combines an African sculpture with mosaic glass, beads, metal keys and a group of cast glass guns.

 Scott’s works delve into the extremes of human nature—conflating humor and horror, beauty and brutality—all the while infusing a deep sense of humanity into the complex conversations of the day.

 Joyce J. Scott (b. 1948, Baltimore) received a BFA (1970) from the Maryland Institute College of Art, an MFA (1971) from Instituto Allende in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. Scott was named a MacArthur fellow in 2016. Recent solo museum exhibitions include: Grounds for Sculpture, NJ (2017), Fuller Craft Museum, MA (2016), MOCA Cleveland (2015), Museum of Art and Design, NYC (2014), Houston Center for Contemporary Art, (2007), Baltimore Museum of Art, MD (2000). Group museum exhibitions include: African American Museum in Philadelphia (2017), Delaware Art Museum (2016), Philadelphia Museum of Art (2015), MFA Boston (2015), and the Metropolitan Museum of Art (2014), among others. Public collections include: Baltimore Museum of Art, MD; Brooklyn Museum of Art, NY; Detroit Institute of the Arts, MI; Los Angeles County Museum of Art, CA; Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY, Museum of Art and Design, NY; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, TX; The Smithsonian, Washington, DC; Philadelphia Museum of Art, PA; Speed Museum, Louisville, KY; Yale University, New Haven, CT, among others.

Earth Manual Project – This Could Save Your Life showcases some of the best practices for dealing with disasters at different stages—from preparedness education to response and relief efforts—with a particular focus on practices that use creative design ideas. Originating in Japan, the exhibition includes examples of work from countries where natural disasters are frequent, such as Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. Projects introduced in the exhibition utilize distinctly creative and innovative approaches to disaster issues.

 The exhibition is curated by Hirokazu Nagata, President of Plus Arts and Vice Director of Design and Creative Center Kobe (KIITO) in Japan.

 The exhibited projects include engaging educational programming and game-like activities, videos that show how to quickly create items that may be needed after a disaster, an annual youth exchange initiative to learn and produce innovative disaster prevention programs involving young professionals and students from 9 countries in Asia, temporary privacy structures designed by architect Shigeru Ban for use in evacuation facilities, and an architectural model showing a town before it was destroyed by the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake in a tsunami to which, as part of a healing process, survivors contributed.

 The inaugural EMP exhibition was held in 2013 at the Design and Creative Center Kobe (KIITO) in Kobe-city, Hyogo, Japan. It has since traveled to several venues in the Philippines and Thailand; this New York exhibition marks its North American debut.

 Embedded within Earth Manual Project is a smaller exhibition, Home is Where the Heart Is, which explores local artists’ reactions to Hurricane Sandy. Curated by two Parsons faculty members, the exhibition features the work of an interdisciplinary group of artists have come together to respond to the hurricane by transforming the rooms of a recovered a dollhouse from one curator’s family’s home in a community devastated by Hurricane Sandy

 Adjacent to the Earth Manual Project exhibition, in the Arnold and Sheila Aronson Galleries, a smaller show titled Disaster Preparedness in Constructed Environments will feature projects focusing on natural disasters created by students in the School of Constructed Environments at Parsons/The New School.

 In conjunction with the exhibition, a panel discussion bringing together three experts on disaster preparedness and their innovative contributions will take place at the Japan Society, New York, on November 14, 2018.

 Earth Manual Project – This Could Save Your Life is an exhibition collaboration between The Japan Foundation Asia Center and Parsons School of Design/The New School, in cooperation with Design and Creative Center Kobe (KIITO) / Plus Arts.

 International transportation for this exhibition is generously supported by ANA (All Nippon Airways Co., Ltd ). This exhibition is made possible with the cooperation of the NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation). Special support is provided by the Permanent Mission of Japan to the United Nations. Special thanks to Japan Society, Inc.; AIG Japan; MUJI (Ryohin Keikaku Co., Ltd.); and Procter &amp; Gamble Japan.

<![CDATA[
The Anita Shapolsky Gallery presents a cross-cultural and transhistorical exploration of the body in art. “Super Bodies” moves beyond our typical focus on abstract expressionist paintings to exhibit art from a potpourri of artists, periods, countries, and media. Antiques from Japan, China, Burma, and Greece from Anita Shapolsky’s own collection are scattered throughout the exhibition to compliment the modern and contemporary works, all exemplifying the ever-present drive to represent the body in both the abstract and the figurative.

 The instinctual drive to creatively capture the body in all its forms has existed for thousands of years. It is a drive that has rooted itself at the very core of our humanity. From ancient Greek kouroi to contemporary portraiture, the human body has served as the artist’s most familiar yet most elusive subject. Even the mid-century abstract expressionists attempted to convey the complexities of thought and emotion – what makes humans human – using their own bodies as translators.

Karma presents its first one-person exhibition with Paul Mogensen. Since the mid-1960s Mogensen has made work that exists unto itself, without any temporal or spatial reference, offering expansive and generous experiences of light, color and form. To preserve both the structure and autonomy of each object, Mogensen does not sign or date his paintings and proceeds with each guided by rules based in elemental mathematics that have been the basis of music and architecture for centuries.

 Each painting is carefully conceived and planned, however the way the artist follows these rules offers innumerable possibilities. In her foreword to Karma’s new monograph, Lynda Benglis writes: “Paul is a colorist who is measured in his method. It may be said that he is a decorative painter as well a painter of a philosophical disposition. He is stringent in his approach, as stringent as a mechanic might be with a Ferrari. There are no accidents.” Spanning 1969 to the present, the paintings and drawings on display are linked by the idea of progressions.

 Mogensen conceived of the earliest works in this exhibition, many never before exhibited, using three different systems, with subdivisions of each, to determine the sequence and size of each color form. The resultant morse-code-like arrays of aluminum, blue, black, green, red, and yellow, against dark colors or bare canvas, can be read as resonant wordless poems, calling to mind the universalist ideas of early 20th century Russian artists and poets admired by Mogensen, such as Mayakovsky, Rodchenko, and Tatlin.

 In recent years, Mogensen has engaged with N+1 progressions, which array growing squares, at equal spacing, around the edges of the canvas, creating a spiraling push and pull between the colors and forms they approach, like a glowing backlit quilt. These works illustrate the tendency for the mind—that is, the whole visual system, from lens to retina to brain—to complete a pattern, to see a form that isn’t there except by implication.

 These and many of Mogensen’s paintings are often recorded after completion in his lush gouache-on-paper works, produced after his paintings using the same principles. The drawings become further iterations of his ideas, both complete works unto themselves and an ad hoc catalog of his production. Mogensen considers all of his work as essentially out of time—there is not a returning to ideas, but rather a continual present in which the animating principles are forever in play.

 Karma has published a comprehensive monograph of Paul Mogensen’s work, with essays by Lynda Benglis, Nancy Princenthal, Klaus Kertess, and Harris Rosenstein, and an interview by Hans Ulrich Obrist.

 Born in Los Angeles in 1941, where he attended the University of Southern California, Mogensen arrived in New York in 1966 already associated with such peers as David Novros and, through Novros, Brice Marden. His first solo exhibition at the Bykert Gallery came the following year. He exhibited regularly with gallery until its closing in 1975. He was been the subject of solo exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and was featured in a group exhibition at the Vienna Secession, Vienna.

 Paul Mogensen’s work is in the collections of major museums in the U.S. and abroad, including: The Museum of Modern Art, New York, NY; The Menil Collection, Houston, TX; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, MN; The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, TX; The Hammer Museum at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA; Harvard Art Museums/Fogg Museum, Cambridge, MA; High Museum of Art, Atlanta, GA; Kunstmuseum Winterthur, Switzerland; New York Public Library, NY; Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, Hartford, CT; and Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, CT.

Onishi Gallery present Innocent Forest, a stunning solo exhibition of pop paintings by artist Shun Sudo. Vividly depicting the fantastical animals and plants of an imaginary realm, Sudo creates images that explode off the canvas, reaching out to the viewer from an alternate reality of color and possibility.

 Based in Tokyo, Japan, Sudo has been deeply influenced by American pop culture throughout his career. After travels across the United States in his 20s, he returned to Japan in his 30s to begin work on paintings that allude to both his creative roots in traditional Japanese culture and contemporary street cultures of Western societies. Integrating both of these influences into his aesthetic sensibilities, Sudo created classic Japanese sumi-e brush stroke paintings covered by graffiti pop art to produce innovatively animated artwork that awakens the eye, mind, and spirit.

 In the series featured in this exhibition, Innocent Forest, Sudo references specific inspiration sources: Ito Jakuchu, a famous Japanese painter of the 18th century, and Akira Toriyama, a contemporary popular Japanese animation artist. Jakuchu illustrated scenes with imaginary birds, animals, flower and plants, merging this world with make-believe through bright colors and modern design. Toriyama draws influences from Disney animation to Chinese novels to Jackie Chan films, creating cartoonish characters, animals, and deities. Sudo’s current series pays particular homage to Jakuchu’s rooster and Toriyama’s animation worlds.

 Visit the Innocent Forest and you encounter a bright yellow rabbit covered with black vegetal designs and a pointed tail, a proud rooster figure wearing royal red booties and a decorative cape, puffed up petals jumping out from their flower centers, dripping ice cream cones and stuffed hamburgers floating off the corners of pages, and birds in flight, flowers, trees, and majestic mountains filling the backgrounds of these fantastical worlds. With spirited strokes and dynamic characters, Sudo guides you through his imaginary kingdom, parallel to our own reality, connecting both through tradition, passion, and creativity.

Ed. Varie presents solo exhibition, Piezo Flora with artist Justin Suazo.

 Piezo is derived from the Greek piezein, which means to squeeze or press. Piezo Flora, Justin Suazo’s debut art exhibition, consists of a series of scanned and reprinted paper towels that were used in the cleaning of micro piezo inkjet printers.

 The cybernetic-flora relationship between human and machine manifests itself in the colors and abstract forms absorbed by Suazo’s meticulous collection of paper towels. Suazo runs a digital printing studio that utilizes this technology and has been amassing paper towels since 2014. Paper towels are left overnight under inkjet printheads to prevent the printer from clogging. They are also used to wipe up spills or catch drips from tools and equipment. These acts of maintenance, which are necessary for the printer and its encompassing business to survive, mimic the reproductive relationship between bees and flowers to their greater plants. Like flowers, the colors and forms that emerge are beautiful and captivating to the human eye.

 The human-machine relationship is doubly realized in the act of scanning and reprinting the printer’s cybernetic blooms. The flower-like simulacrum of having advance imaging technology recreate the organic and abstract image it once oozed and bled is both beautiful and perverse. It is a physical imaging feedback loop. It is a digital-physical double flower mutation - the outcome of human, machine, and commercial systems intersecting.

 By outfitting his printers to use reactive dye, these prints have a naturally-embedded vibrancy and density. Reactive dye is specifically used in natural fabrics like silk and cotton. Instead of sitting on top of substrates the way pigment inks do, dye penetrates the fibers. When the dye is bonded to the fibers through steaming, the colors spring into life.

 “I like to try and imagine the way certain flowers like orchids or dianthus get their color. I’ve yet to see footage of a Sweet William dianthus or a Yellow Speckle orchid get its color, but I imagine it occurs when no one is looking in the middle of the night inside the flower’s private enclosure.”

In 1843 Anna Atkins began producing Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions, the first book to be printed and illustrated using photography. Today, 175 years later, her landmark project—compelling in its fusion of science and art, its modernity, and its realization by a woman in an age

<![CDATA[
Ubu Gallery’s exhibition of Judit Reigl’s Weightlessness paintings (formally Expérience d’apensenteur, 1965–1966) is the first ever to be exclusively dedicated to this important series. It is also the third solo exhibition presented by Ubu of Reigl, one of the most original figures of post-World War II art. Reigl is hailed for discarding boundaries and rules once deemed absolute. Now 95, Reigl defies traditional and often antagonistic dichotomies as she obliterates the distinction between the front and back of the canvas, utilizing both sides of the work, alternates between the figurative and non-objective and reconciles aspects of Surrealism and abstraction.

 According to the critic Marcia E. Vetrocq, “Reigl had been working on the abstract series Mass Writing (Ecriture en mass, 1956–1966) when its jagged zones of paint began to expand and evoke fragments of the deconstructed body. She discerned the start of a new series, Weightlessness, whose abstraction then yielded to the overtly figurative paintings of Man (Homme, 1966–1972).” Rectangles of roughly 45 x 35 inches (115 x 90 cm), the Weightlessness canvases comprise the final subseries of Mass Writing. While the paintings of the Weightlessness series are readily distinguishable from the rest of her oeuvre by their relatively small size, they are also recognizable by virtue of Reigl’s use of a well-respected painter’s trick. For her earlier Mass Writing paintings, Reigl propped large, stretched canvases against the studio wall and troweled on the paint with upward motions. The ascending movement, preserved as rich texture, is accented by the occasional drip. In making the Weightlessness series, to reinforce the effect of the upward flow, Reigl applied thick layers of paint and then turned the wet painting upside down to dry, thereby adding the pull of gravity to her effort. With the canvas rotated back, the paint, flouting Newton’s law of universal gravitation, sags and drips upward. This sensation of weightlessness derives not only from the texture and the drips; the sharply divided forms of the paintings seem to rise from the canvas, equally defying the gravitational pull.

 Reigl’s escape from her native Hungary for Paris in 1950 was arduous and perilous. In 1954, André Breton presented Reigl’s first solo exhibition; since then she has shown consistently in museums and galleries throughout Europe and the United States. Most recently, the Musée d’Art Moderne in Paris mounted a survey of her work and she will be included in the Metropolitan Museum’s Epic Abstraction: Pollock to Herrera exhibition, which opens on December 17th. .

 Ubu’s presentation coincides with an exhibition of the artist’s recent drawings, Judit Reigl: Dance of Death, at the Shepherd W &amp; K Galleries located at 58 East 79th Street, New York NY and on view from September 25–October 20, 2018. Both exhibitions are presented in collaboration with Janos Gat Gallery.

<![CDATA[
The Jane Hartsook Gallery presents new work by Cristina Tufiño. Tufiño is an interdisciplinary artist whose work draws on matriarchal power and sexuality. In this new body of sculptural work, Tufiño develops the exploration she began in her video essay Dear Pilar (2018), using historical symbols and personal experiences to explore the tension between biographical representation, memory and desire. This is the artist’s first solo exhibition.

 Appearing improvisational at first, consideration shows how carefully Tufiño has layered historical reference with autobiographical imagery. A collection of cast ceramic keyboards, cat heads, fingers and pineapples stand out as the refuse of some past-present millennial culture, waiting to be discovered by a future archeologist. The palette of the installation as a whole is sourced from the vibrant colors of ancient Greek statues before they were eroded by time. The embracing sphinxes twine together the disparate histories of Ancient Egypt, French Egyptian Revival furniture and the vernacular art of Las Vegas architecture and tourist souvenirs.

 Tufiño connects these broader historical references to her personal experience, juxtaposing archeological references with images of her childhood home in San Juan, Puerto Rico, her travels to Tokyo, Japan and her visits to the lush gardens of the Chateau de Fontainebleau in France. The ceramic polaroid picture wall reliefs are fragmented memories—both real and imagined from 2001—drawn from personal photographs, found images of bar hostesses in Tokyo, and women bored and drinking in bars or coming home to mundane lives. This collage of artifacts comes together as an imagined vision into the past through a future nostalgia, a nostalgia that is sensual and bright despite its dark undertones.

 Cristina Tufiño (b. 1982) was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico and lives and works between Philadelphia, PA and New York, NY. Tufiño received her MFA from the University of Pennsylvania, her BFA in photography from the Rhode Island School of Design, and her BA in art history from the University of Puerto Rico. Her work has been shown in a number of solo, two-person and group exhibitions including at: Knockdown Center (Queens, NY; 2018), Galería Agustina Ferreyra (Mexico City, Mexico; 2018), NADA NY (New York, NY; 2017), The Hole (New York, NY; 2018), Ruberta (Los Angeles, CA; 2017) and Hidrante (San Juan, Puerto Rico; 2016). Tufiño has won the ARTADIA Award (2016) and the Chenven Foundation Artist Grant (2016) and been artist in residence at the Loisaida Arts Center (New York, NY; 2016) and the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture (Madison, ME; 2012).

Calico presents The Opposite of Water is Salt, a solo exhibition of recent photography and installation work by Lauren Silberman.

 There is a contradiction that exists in the desert about an hour east of Joshua Tree. There is a small town (technically an unincorporated community) mostly abandoned (population of 4) called Amboy that sits on a stretch of Route 66 - the now seldom traveled “Main Street of America.” It sits at the bottom of a valley in the Mojave an hour east of Joshua Tree past the salt flats and ravines of the National Chloride Company.

 You can’t miss Amboy. A giant old sign for Roy’s Motel &amp; Cafe rises in the distance after a long stretch of nothing. What seems to be a beacon upon finding it after long stretches of desolate desert road is actually just an old, abandoned motel and a gas station, – a giant something miles from nothing.

 A seeming oasis in a vast, literal desert.

 But it isn’t an oasis. Roy’s is bright and shiny in the distance, so real and so clear and bright, but there is actually nothing there. No town. No cafe. No hotel. No kitchen. Not even water. Just salt runs out of the tap. It’s a mirage. The opposite of an oasis. Salt is fact and water is fiction in the town of Amboy.

 Silberman’s The Opposite of Salt is Water uses images from Amboy and the surrounding desert areas to investigate the ideology and the mythological narratives surrounding the concept of the American Dream and what it means now. An image of a natural oasis set against images of an abandoned town and rest stop on a popular thoroughfare pose the questions: which is the mirage and which is the oasis?

 Lauren Silberman lives and works in New York City. She received her MFA from the International Center of Photography-Bard Program in Advanced Photographic Studies and her BA in Art History from Barnard College. She is currently a faculty member at the International Center of Photography. Lauren has completed residencies with A-Z West (Joshua Tree, California, 2018 and 2016), ArtGarda (Italy, 2015), Mana Contemporary (New Jersey, 2015), the Camera Club of New York (NYC, 2012), the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council Workspace program (2009) and was a Visiting Scholar at NYU’s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. She has performed at Location One, Deitch Projects, and 3rd Ward, as well as the several underground events and venues that have provided inspiration for her work. Silberman also devotes time to curating shows; her recent projects include A Rose is a Rose is A Rose, a one-night show in the garden at Crest Hardware, It was a Pleasure to Burn featuring JoKarlins at the SPRING/BREAK ART SHOW 2017, and Doppelnamer, included in the SPRING/BREAK Art Show in 2016. She has been featured in PDN’s photo annual as emerging talent and exhibited in New York and abroad. Some of Lauren’s commercial clients include The New Yorker, NYLON Magazine, Fortune Magazine, Vice, Details Magazine, Bust Magazine, Brooklyn Industries. Her work has been featured in New York Times Magazine and Vogue Italia.

Paula Wilson’s mixed-media installation transforms Smack Mellon’s industrial space into a landscape resembling the high desert plains of New Mexico where the artist lives. Central among the flora and fauna depicted are the yucca plant and yucca moth. Their pollination ritual represents a quintessential example of mutualism, which Wilson reimagines as a love scene. A video shows naturalists manifesting the pollinating dance, while printed wall hangings illustrate larger than life figurative representations of embodied stages of the yucca plant: blossom, pod, seed. By portraying an untold narrative of black and brown ecologists, Wilson draws connections between the human rights and environmental movements and offers a paradigm for how embracing the natural world can engender harmony.

Luisa Caldwell’s exhibition encompasses personal interests that have spanned her childhood and adult life: cats, flowers, and art books. Her project is inspired by the flowers she grows in her Brooklyn garden, as well as the stray cats that come and go. On the gallery walls are hundreds of Caldwell’s pen and marker botanicals, illustrating fantastic flora. Caldwell has also created an installation of found porcelain and stoneware vases that have her own feline and botanical imagery etched in the surface. Rather than exhibiting these vessels on traditional bases, she displays them on stacks of art books that refer to the influences that spill into the content of her work.

Curated by Bridget Donlon
 Featuring works by:
 Alex McQuilkin, Erin M. Riley, and Martha Tuttle

 D O R S K Y G A L L E R Y | Curatorial Programs presents Complicated Territory curated by Bridget Donlon.

 Complicated Territory features three artists, Alex McQuilkin, Erin M. Riley, and Martha Tuttle, whose work encompasses a variety of media including painting, drawing, installation, and embroidery. Taking on traditionally feminine subjects and forms– interiors, domesticity, self-reflection, florals, pastels, handicraft– t o explore and critique this identity and how it is regarded in society, these artists create work grounded in feminist (art) history, with cutting sensibilities of irony, detachment, sexuality, and pop culture saturation. Each creates work that delves into the complicated territory of a specific kind of female identity, psychology, and navigation of life.

 Bridget Donlon is a Brooklyn-based contemporary art professional with experience in curating and arts administration and institutions including the Tang Museum, the Guerrilla Girls, Galerie Lelong, Tate Modern, the Fabric Workshop and Museum, and Dieu Donné. Recent curatorial projects have included On Reflection at UrbanGlass in Brooklyn and Confluence/Influence in Contemporary Abstraction at Dorsky Gallery Curatorial Programs in Long Island City. She curated Pure Pulp: Contemporary Artist Working in Paper, a 15 year retrospective of works from Dieu Donné’s residency program for the Wellin Museum of Hamilton College, which traveled to the Robert C. Williams Museum of Papermaking at Georgia Tech and the Dedalus Foundation at Industry City, Brooklyn, and was accompanied by a catalog published by Demonico/Prestel.

 EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

 LIGHTNING fills the night sky. THUNDER BOOMS overhead. The
 wind whips the RAIN furiously against anything in its path.
 The CAMERA moves slowly along rows of beautiful HOMES. At the
 end is a cul-de-sac. Several POLICE CARS are in the driveway,
 their RED LIGHTS FLASHING.

 A four-door SEDAN pulls into the driveway. JOHN CARDENAS steps
 out into the rain. He is a handsome Latin in his thirties,
 with hard, chiseled features and black, slicked-backed hair.
 He does not run through the rain — he walks.

 DETECTIVE REESE, a man who looks more like an accountant than a
 homicide detective runs out to meet him.

 CARDENAS
 Is it Marsh?

 REESE
 Yeah.

 Just a hint of sadness shows on Cardenas’ face. It lasts an
 instant, then it’s gone.

 REESE
 Sir, do you mind if we get out of the
 rain?

 Cardenas doesn’t move. He ignores the question.

 CARDENAS
 Who found him?

l and the fetishized, to create dreamlike unions of household objects and found photography.

 The Last Raft is a room-sized installation combining overturned and dismembered furniture, glassware, and pills, with clippings of vintage erotica. The precarious placement of the photographs on glass, chair legs and the floor forces viewers to bow if they wish to examine the posing nudes. This role reversal challenges the traditional relationship between the observer and the observed, the voyeur and the nude.

 Past is a series of assemblages comprised of male pin-ups set between the folds of button-down shirts. Traditionally, male nudity has been portrayed much less frequently than the female: after all, most exhibited artists and published photographers are men, conditioned to exert their heterosexual dominance. Neatly folded, yet revealing the repressed images, the dress shirts underscore the futility of social control over primal instincts.

 Completing the exhibition is a film composed of vintage photographs of female nudes, which Cais found at an antique road show. The artist transforms and revitalizes the images which had been left for dead amidst the clutter of domestic life. Having been hypersexualized and discarded, the bodies acquire new form as actors in silent cinema of their own direction.
 ​
 Nino Cais (Brazil, 1969) studied Art at Santa Marcelina University (Fasm) in São Paulo. Since graduating in 2001, he has participated in several exhibitions in Brazil, such as the 30th International São Paulo Biennial (2012) and the 3rd Bahia Biennial (2014), as well as in Mexico, France, USA, China, Portugal and Lithuania, where his works were exhibited at Kaunas Art Biennial TEXTILE 07.

<![CDATA[
Lichtundfire presents Minimal Impact, a carefully constructed and focused exhibition of mixed media paintings, drawings and works on paper, through the lens of three artists, Augustus Goertz, Alan Steele, and Christopher Stout, all of whom have shown their work in the past at Lichtundfire.

 Taking the common meaning of the term to another level of connotation- the Minimal Impact here lies in the sparsity of the application, delicate expression or subtle reference, however resulting in a powerful conceptual language.

 In many ways, closely linked, however differing in their practice and in the execution of their mediums, the individual artist’s work strongly stands alone yet ‘inter pares’- within equals- creating a visual dialogue between textures, lines and hues.

 Augustus Goertz, a process painter, conceives sensible poetic abstractions. Referring to them as ‘controlled improvisations’ his surfaces - out of an amalgamate of ingredients- span from the sparse to the compact, with paint from the bolt colorful to the monochromatic sublime.

 “Each series has an overriding conception. Within the confines of this trajectory, there’s a lot of room for improvisation and experimentation during the creative act. Trying to push the limits of what paint or other chemicals can do. Painting is, among other things, philosophy made manifest. One can say, the artist works in the area just ahead of the scientist, like a scout.”

 Alan Steele’s carefully crafted drawings/works on paper evoke the concept of the Japanese Wabi-Sabi where concept and composition align to conceive the highest form of perfect imperfection/ imperfect perfection.

 “The earliest initial idea was to create a map that would set before me an ordered totality so that ideas and concepts, which are finite and particular, may have a setting in an infinity. In this way local control, preplanning and decisions, can be manifested and articulated.

 The map was to serve as a yardstick, that by its repeated use in measuring would generated a continuum of ideas. Thus the work would be free to move in a unlimited extension toward the infinite.”

 Christopher Stout’s elegant, monochromatic multi-panel paintings, radiate and soundly resonate and yet seem to hover in an enigmatic space we cannot enter. As an abstract reductive artist his work concerns “a dance between the questions of “what is the construct of painting?” and “what is the construct of sculpture?””. His quest, as Stout phrases it, “is the additive outcome in merging the vocabularies of both disciplines.”

 Augustus Goertz is a New York artist, who was born and raised in New York City. He holds a BFA from the San Francisco Art Institute in San Francisco, CA. This is his 11th appearance at Lichtundfire, where he previously also co-curated the exhibition SPORTSVERGNUEGEN with artist, curator, writer D. Dominick Lombardi.

 Alan Steele was born in Caracas, Venezuela and holds a BFA from the School of Visual Arts (SVA), NYC, NY and an MFA from Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), Providence, RI. He previously took part in one exhibition at Lichtundfire.

 Christopher Stout is new York based artist, born and raised in Maryland. Previously, Stout had 2 solo exhibition at Lichtundfire an this is his 8th appearance at the gallery.

Sla307 Art Space presents two outsider artists Saulius Siuksta and Hiroshi Shuto in a duo exhibition entitled two.

 In this particular case we are using the “outsider” definition differently then it is commonly used. Most often it refers to a creative person without a formal art education, who’s work is sometimes visionary, strange, obsessive, or asocial, or all that combined. Hiroshi and Saulius are very well trained sculptors, both 20 year New York natives, they are well acquainted with contemporary art as they’ve worked in the art related fields their whole lives. They consider themselves to be more like New York “outsider” artists.

 The correlation between Japanese and Lithuanian cultural backgrounds of these two artists is complicated, and probably isn’t so crucial, or obvious for neither Hiroshi or Saulius openly exploit their cultural origins. However, it seems that a focus on formal understatement, love for details, materials, repetition and symbolic content are very much appreciated and are featured in both artist’s work. Each artist is walking a very personal path, but also through that, they are trying to create something universal.

 SAULIUS SIUKSTA is exhibiting his series of drawings entitled Reflections. The drawings are displayed without frames directly on the gallery wall in one long line, which purposefully creates a panoramic landscape filled with sculptures and human figures that spread evenly across the central space throughout the drawings. In these graphite compositions figures seem to be engaged in strange and mysterious rituals. The artist tries to recreate his dreams, or what he remembers from them in his work. He spent several years to create this series of drawings and it is the first time that they are being shown in a gallery in New York City.

 Saulius Siuksta is a Lithuanian born artist who lives in New York City. He works in sculpture, painting, drawing, photo, and video. The artist received his MFA in Sculpture at The Vilnius Academy of Arts in Vilnius, Lithuania. He has been a member of The Lithuanian Artist Union since 1990. His works are held in the collections of the Lithuanian Art Museums and private collectors in Europe and USA.

 Imagine the shape of sound, or the velocity of distance between one person to another. You may discover this imaginable theory in my artistic creation. You will experience a dimension that will explore the “walls” that border between countries and social life. Through cutting the mouth, eyes, legs; you are visualizing a cell merge intricately composed from abstract objects. Walls allude to subdivision, a statement of separation though contrary, that brings them together.

 Hiroshi Shuto is a Japanese born artist based in New York City. It was in 1993 when he earned his degree from the Tokyo Designer Institute, Japan. He studied sculpture and painting at the School of Visual Arts (SVA), NY. Hiroshi uses different materials: plaster, Styrofoam, aqua resin, wooden sticks, wax, bronze and epoxy, aiming for an unusual tactile quality: the subject matter arises out of it. He also collaborated with others on major art projects through studios in New York and was a sculptor for a project at Levi’s Stadium, San Francisco, CA.; at The Puerto Rico Museum of Sports, Guaynabo, P.R.; and at Lincoln Center, New York.

JANET BORDEN, INC. presents an exhibition of new work by polymath artist ROBERT CUMMING.
 ROBERT CUMMING: IMPLIED NARRATIVE presents drawings of nudes. They seem drawn from life, but they are the product of his imagination, abetted by a few photographs.

 Cumming’s drawings imply a compelling yet elusive narrative, informed by his overlapping interest and facility in painting, sculpture, and photography. Recurring motifs of measuring, architecture, and the human form, present clues to a nonexistent mystery.
 In 2005’s Camera Club, two females wander around in a modernist living room with their cameras at the ready. Their nudity is of no importance, except that the modeling and the tonality of the figures are the dominant features of the drawing. Is there a story there?
 Conte crayon and pastels are the mediums. Cumming’s extraordinary talent belies the difficulty of working with these materials on black or colored paper. As critic Loring Knoblauch observed, “With Cumming, it’s a constant pitched battle of cerebral illogic.”
 This is Robert Cumming’s eighth exhibition with the gallery.

 ROBERT CUMMING was born in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1943. He currently is moving from Whately, Massachusetts to Desert Palms, California. His painting, sculpture and photographic work have all been widely exhibited since the early 1970s. He has received grants from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, 1980-1981; the National Endowment for the Arts, 1972, 1975, 1979. His photographs were shown in 1999 at The Museum of Modern Art in a solo exhibition, “The Clutter of Happenstance” Among his many other solo exhibitions are: Hirshhorn Museum, Washington, DC; Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego; A retrospective of his photography, The Difficulties of Nonsense, was exhibited first at George Eastman Museum, Rochester in 2017, and will open at UCR/California Museum of Photography in 2019.

Driven by the desire for adventure and discovery, Cobi Moules latest series of paintings document his journey across America not only to explore the country’s natural beauty and diversity, but also to reflect upon his position within it.

 Moules deftly manipulates the visual trope of traditional landscape painting as a way of seeking inclusion, creating a utopian space for his personal significance and queer identity. He embraces the beauty of nature while shifting its weight through the exaltation of his own existence within it. The importance becomes the experiences of his multiples and their overall existence in the landscape - each engaging in different activities, exploring their [his] presence within nature, and ultimately becoming whole.

ClampArt presents “Frances F. Denny | Major Arcana: Witches in America,” the artist’s second solo show at the gallery.

 “Major Arcana: Witches in America” is a collection of portraits of women from across the United States who identify as witches. Each woman photographed for “Major Arcana” pursues a form of witchcraft, whether aligned with a religion (like Wicca or Voudou) or a self-defined practice. Many consider themselves pagan and engage in a diversity of traditions, including: mysticism, engagement with the occult, politically-oriented activism, polytheism, ritualized “spell-craft,” and plant-based healing.

 Denny’s interest in modern-day witches began when she discovered during the course of research for a prior body of work that her 8th great-grandmother was accused of witchcraft in 1674 in Northampton, Massachusetts, and that nearly twenty years later, in 1692, her 10th great-grandfather presided as a judge in the Salem Witch Trials. She states: “[T]his ancestral coincidence stayed with me. What is a witch? Who does that word belong to—now?” In pursuit of her answer, Denny traveled coast-to-coast, meeting and photographing witches of diverse backgrounds with varying connections to the practice of witchcraft.

 The historical oppression of those who practiced (or were merely accused of practicing) witchcraft is widely known; as early as 15th-century Europe, those condemned as witches faced torture and even death. However, recent decades have seen a reclaiming of the word “witch.” In the mid-20th century, emerging pagan communities in the United States and Europe began embracing the term, and since then, “witch” has been adopted by a diverse group of people. “Major Arcana” reflects that spectrum, re-framing the witch as a feminist archetype as well as the contemporary embodiment of a defiant, unsanctioned femininity. Today, as the current wave of feminism crests, one characterized by political activism, #metoo, and intersectionality—not to mention a certain cultural trendiness—witchcraft is suddenly relevant again to the mainstream.



 Frances F. Denny (b. 1984) is an artist based in Brooklyn, New York, whose work investigates the development of female selfhood and identity. Her monograph, Let Virtue Be Your Guide, was published by Radius Books in 2015. She holds an MFA from the Rhode Island School of Design and a BA from the Gallatin School at New York University.

Bowery presents Michael Louis Johnson’s second exhibition with the gallery. The artist’s recent work includes self-portraits and cityscapes produced in oil paint and oil stick on paper and canvas.

 Almost all the works are from observation, and many painted from a bank of windows overlooking northern Manhattan. The artist describes this latest work, notable for its brisk drawing and vibrant colors, as reflecting “…my response to what came before, and my evolving thoughts about painting.”

Diane Drescher’s third show at Bowery presents recent paintings inspired by the artist’s trips to New Mexico, where her painting sites included the ruins of a seventeenth-century mission and pueblo in Pecos National Historic Park.

 Many painters of the desert turn to an idiosyncratic painting language because of the geological extremes and the ever-changing clouds and sky; old adobe buildings literally rise out of the dirt they are standing on. Drescher, whose quietly radiant paintings reflect her pursuit of such essences, likes to quote Lawrence Clark Powell’s advice to writers exploring the Southwest:
 Seek essences, enduring things, touchstones and symbols; try to recreate in prose what makes this country so increasingly meaningful and necessary to one. Altitude, distance, color, configuration, history, and culture — in them dwell the essential things, but they must be extracted.

Organized by Howard Singerman and Sarah Watson with Agnes Gund Curatorial Fellows Clara Chapin, Marie Coneys, Miles Debas, Jazmine Hayes, and Tess Thackara

 Acts of Art and Rebuttal revisits the 1971 exhibition Rebuttal to the Whitney Museum Exhibition: Black Artists in Rebuttal, which was organized by members of the Black Emergency Cultural Coalition at Acts of Art, a small, artist-run gallery in Greenwich Village. The original exhibition was mounted in response to the Whitney Museum’s refusal to appoint a Black curator for their survey Contemporary Black Artists in America.

 The exhibition at Hunter presents ten of the 47 artists from the original Rebuttal show, including Benny Andrews, Betty Blayton-Taylor, Vivian Browne, James Denmark, Cliff Joseph, Richard Mayhew, Dindga McCannon, Ademola Olugebefola, Haywood Bill Rivers, and Frank Wimberley. It is a selection intended to represent the stylistic diversity of the original exhibition, with works ranging from sardonic social satire and biting figurative expressionism to Yoruban-inspired symbolism and lyrical abstraction. Through these artists, the exhibition also traces a network of organizations and groups that supported the aspirations of Black artists and the community in the 1960s and early 1970s, among them: the Black Emergency Cultural Coalition; the Spiral group; the Studio Museum in Harlem; the Black nationalist artists’ group Weusi; and the Black women’s artist collective Where We At. Through its survey of the history of the short-lived Acts of Art gallery and the events leading up to the Rebuttal show, the exhibition and its accompanying catalogue explore the intersections between Black cultural communities and cultural politics in Greenwich Village, the Lower East Side, and Harlem in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

 Where possible, Acts of Art and Rebuttal presents works that were originally installed in the 1971 Rebuttal show, including works by Blayton-Taylor, Browne, Denmark, Joseph, and Rivers. In addition to the twenty paintings, prints, and collages, the exhibition includes a collection of posters, newspapers, mailers, and letters documenting Acts of Art, the Rebuttal show, and responses to it. Accompanying the ephemera is a 45-minute film by art historian Oakley N. Holmes, Jr. that documents the “Black Artists in America” panel held at the Art Students League in February 1971. The panelists include Andrews, Browne, Joseph, Mayhew, and other Black artists central to the moment, as well as Nigel Jackson, the founder of Acts of Art.

 “The Rebuttal show,” as Benny Andrews wrote in 1971, “offers a chance to give art historians a handle to grasp in putting whatsoever it is that happened this time in history concerning a group of artists identified by their Black skins.” Acts of Art and Rebuttal takes up that handle and Andrews’s invitation to “grasp…this time in history.”

Curated by Mark Beard

 ClampArt presents “Bruce Sargeant (1898-1938): The Lost Murals”—curated by New York artist Mark Beard (Bruce Sargeant’s great nephew).

 Mark Beard has devoted more than two decades of his life to researching and collecting the work of Bruce Sargeant, a painter who largely concentrated on the idealization and celebration of the male form. Had Sargeant not met with a tragic and untimely death at the age of 40, he may have gone on to achieve the fame and renown awarded to such painters as James McNeill Whistler, Thomas Eakins, and Winslow Homer—artists to whom his style is often compared. Instead, Sargeant’s oeuvre remained relatively unknown for years until it was brought to light by the efforts of Beard.

 “The Lost Murals” brings together large-scale canvases that were known to exist but hidden from public view for over half a century. After years of meticulous research, Beard located the murals and painstakingly arranged for their return from a number of locations around the globe. In the murals, Beard’s great-uncle portrays his favorite subject: muscular young men at the peak of form and athletic prowess. Clothed in wrestling singlets, tank tops, boxer shorts, and crisp, white dress shirts, the athletes are shown flexing and cavorting among ropes, rings, beams, and other gymnastic equipment. Seen together for the first time, these murals are Sargeant’s Sistene Chapel ceiling.

 Mark Beard (1956-) was born and raised in Salt Lake City. His portraits, nudes, bronzes, and handcrafted books have been exhibited worldwide, and he has also designed more than twenty theatrical sets in New York, London, and Germany. His works are in numerous museum collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art, Hartford, Connecticut; and the Princeton, Harvard, and Yale University Museums, among many others.

“Are you ready for the flood?” Zoe Strauss asks us. It’s a trick question. You’re too late. The flood is already here. The only question is what you can grab, how you’re going to leave, and what goddesses, nymphs and naiads might appear to lead you on your way.

 I-95, the decennial installation that defined the first half of Strauss’s career, culminated in her blockbuster 10 Years retrospective at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Since then, through a series of commissions and fellowships, Strauss has been plotting part two, an epic of the deluge that will dominate the second half of her creative life.

 Similar to the Works in Progress shows that propelled I-95, this new work will be filled with performances, installations, camp meetings and boat trips. Some photographs, too! Madison Avenue, opening on October 4th at Meislin Projects, brings the road show to America’s actual boulevard of broken dreams.

 There’s black mold behind the wallpaper at the foreclosed Trump Taj Mahal, flypaper in the chandeliers, and flood marks near the ceiling in Staten Island bungalows and Louisiana cottages. A fallen angel tumbles from the Sarasota sky in front of Katherine Harris’s Mediterranean manse. Words fade away and are forgotten. Liquid flows into liquidation.

 What have the Madison Avenue Men sold us? A return to normalcy? Greatness again? That schoolgirl complexion? A good deal on some gently used, gold-tasseled drapes? Maybe Albert Lasker knew, before he was taken at the flood.

 Zoe Strauss: Madison Avenue builds on invitational residencies at the American Academy in Rome, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, and the Carnegie International. Madison Avenue is the first Works in Progress installation supporting Commencement, Ms. Strauss’s upcoming long-term project.

al values, and her analysis of its interesting correlation to the art market.

 Artist on the Project

 Marriage has always been one of the most important topics among Chinese of various age groups. Numerous fairytales, sayings, and metaphors related to marriage and women exist. Some examples are “It is better for a woman to have a good marriage than a good job” and “filial piety is one of the virtues to be held above all else.” “Three forms of unfilial conduct exist, of which no posterity is the greatest.” All of the sayings that are learnt by heart since Chinese people were children become heavily infused into their bodies and become a part of their consciousness, which is even more true for elder generations.

 This body of work comes out of an on-going research project I began in 2017 around the marriage market in China. I have been examining closely the different social phenomenon and industries associated with marriage. Examples include commercial matchmaking agents and companies, blind date TV shows, online dating apps and matchmaking corners in both metropolitan and secondary cities, where unmarried adults’ parents are gathered together to trade their children’s information. During this examination I attempted to study the social cause behind this collective anxiety around marriage, and how it existed across generations in China.

 Furen Dai received a Bachelor in Russian Language studies from Beijing Foreign Studies University in 2010, a Graduate Diploma in Entrepreneurial Management from Boston University. She also holds a MFA degree from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts University in 2016. Her work has been widely exhibited in the U.S. and around the world. Past exhibitions include 13th Athens Digital Arts Festival (Greece), OSMOSIS Audiovisual Media festival 2017 (Taiwan), Illuminus Boston 2017, Now&amp;After‘16, The State Darwin Museum (Moscow). She is a recipient for The Milton and Sally Avery Arts Foundation Fellowship in 2017, Excellence Award for the 21st Japan Media Arts Festival. The exhibition at 456 Gallery will be her first solo show in New York.

Organized by Carole Naggar, poet, artist, curator, educator, and photography historian

 This exhibition features thirty-four self-published photobooks, varying in sizes and aspect, usually printed in small editions. Their form varies from the classic, traditionally printed book to the zine, the folio, the leporello book, the panoramic shape, the I-phone… Also including selected photographs, Inside/Out shows a range of media from gelatin prints to C-prints, collotype, inkjet and Xerox.

 Roundtable Discussion: Friday, October 19, 2018, 6:30 pm
 MONICA ONG: CELESTIAL BODIES

 (ce•les•tial)

 1: of or relating to the sky or visible heavens
 2: (capitalized) of or relating to China or the Chinese
 3: eminently pleasing

 Monica Ong is a visual poet whose new series of hybrid image-poems experiment with diagram and diary at the intersection of language, art, and science. Her recent body of work draws from astronomical diagrams and maps, weaving in echoes of her own migratory lineage to explore precarious territories of motherhood, gender, and identity.

 Artist Talk: Friday, November 2, 2018, 6:30 pm

 SALLY ALATALO: CULTIVATING BOOK AND LAND

 Sally Alatalo’s practice coalesces around a habit of parsing the quotidian for all it’s worth, and percolates in the hybrid realms of language collage, visual poetry, artists’ books, unruly archives and performative events. Her current projects originate in the rehabilitation of an orchard and woodlands in rural SW Michigan as a site to investigate agri/horti/cultur/al practices, and where she is eager to bridge her interests in language and its dissemination with the discourses of rural economies.

 Artist Talk: Friday, December 7, 2018, 6:30 pm

Metropolis Gallery will host the Bianchi exhibi. The trading cards, published by Upper Deck, will also be released in October.

 One of the most renowned comic artists working today, Bianchi is best known in the U.S. for his work in X-Men, Avengers, Spider-Man, Thanos, Wolverine and Star Wars comics, as well as his signature watercolor and ink wash style.

 “Simone brings a certain aesthetic to everything he does,” says Metropolis Gallery curator and owner, Vincent Zurzolo. “It’s distinctly European, filled with dynamic tension and a distinct mood that in-and-of-itself can only be described as Simone Bianchi.”

 The Metropolis exhibit will feature more than 50 paintings from the Marvel Masterpieces 135-piece set—all on sale, with prices ranging from $2,500-$14,000. The rest of the collection will be exhibited simultaneously in Bianchi’s hometown of Lucca, Italy.

 From 1992 to 2008, release of a Marvel Masterpieces card set was a highly-anticipated comic art event that showcased the work of greats such as Greg and Tim Hildebrandt. In 2016, Marvel revived the tradition—now biennial—with a new, 100-piece card set created by Joe Jusko, who also painted the original 1992 set.

 The opening reception will be held Friday, October 5 from 6-9pm. It is open to the public.

 Thereafter, the exhibit is open Tuesday-Friday, 11am-5pm through the end of December. As always, the gallery’s permanent exhibit also will be available for viewing, featuring art by iconic artists such as Kirby, Ditko, Frazetta, Gil Kane and Neal Adams, among others.

 “Think about it,” says Zurzolo. ““Here’s a rare chance to own an original piece of art featuring your favorite Marvel hero or villain—and it’s also a trading card, too.”

 “I’ve long been a fan of the contemporary Italian comic painters. The chance to represent Simone’s work is quite a thrill for me on a personal and professional level.”

“Peony Intelligences: Patterns, Conversations and Dynamics”
 By Michelle Zhuomin Cai Sun
 Plants have intelligence. Plants can sense, move, dance, sleep and search for the sun. They communicate with other plants and insects. Plants, flower scrubs and trees have brains according to neuroscientists. Trees in nature communicate with and support each other to form complicated networks for survival and better ecological growth. In this exhibit, the visual images are created to show peony intelligences, adopted from Howard Gardner’s multiple intelligences. Like other flowers, peonies show mathematical intelligence forming the Fibonacci curves, circles, numbers, and the golden ratio of 1.618. Also, my peonies are positioned to dialogue with each other revealing their interpersonal intelligences. They converse with each other showing personalities and moods such as laughter, whisper, garden talk, spiritual dialogue, bosom share and infant talk.

 Interestingly, my peony speaks with scientific intelligence. One of my flowers Peony-Space is a floral image crafted from a pink Paeonia suffruticosa named Tianyi 天衣enveloped by clouds to address the power of empty space. There is a fusion with the philosophy of Laozi, dated sixth century B.C.E, that states the driving force of a wheel not through the spokes but the empty space within. This ancient insight is consistent with the principle of quantum physics that explains, inside an atom, the protons and neutrons as governed by quarks, the empty space within which is constantly moving like a bubbling soup. This vacuum is full of quantum fuel fluctuations that possess an enormous amount of energy. These vacuum fluctuations are essential for our existence. Like in Peony-Space, the space is created with a pulling energy that keeps the flower in motion, the blossoming vigor and the force of life.


 Ashok Jain Gallery is pleased to present a group exhibition featuring the works of Marc Deppe, Dan Obana and Zohar Wallach, Fernando Pomalaza and Maria Bernal.

 Marc Deppe is an American artist who was based in China as a artist and teacher. As he says ” I continue to ask the questions, “What works?” “What doesn’t work?” “What IS work?” “What ISN’T work?” This process of self-reflection can only be done honestly through human effort, discipline, and will”. In his art and life he has and continues discovering possibilities for growth, understanding, and spirituality amidst simple-minded use of technology, material excess and social conformity.

 “What is a Teacher?

 -A good Teacher is someone who in any learning situation or environment facilitates openness rather than imposes or submits to the social and material concerns of the community or society in which he lives.
 -A good Teacher is not a clown (too much performing, silliness, playing games) or a robot (pretending to be interested, a “nice” guy, standing in front of the classroom looking good).

 -A good Teacher doesn’t overly on technology or a clever ability to social network.
 -A good Teacher has taken the time and has the inner strength and courage to develop a mature understanding and appreciation for human growth regardless of cultural and language differences” – artist expresses his vision.

 Dan Obana represents Japanese digital art scene since 2003 and has been exhibited widely at international art destinations such as Fukuoka, New York, Bangkok and Tokyo. Obana uses the most advanced 3DCG technologies to create the art that has never been seen before. “The 3D digital world in which I create my works is full of opportunities to encounter by chance”, says the artist. Using the computer graphic technique to build multi-faced compositions and his intuitive creativity artist blurs the lines between reality and imagination. All compositions are instinctively but actively built, layer by layer to reveal the surreal world of imagery. “The process of grasping and adding more imagination to the accidental scene encountered by chance and inflating the image through trial and error is very attractive to me”, explains Obana.

 An associate member of the Japan Print Association, he has won a number of awards, including the Excellent Work Prize at the Asia Graph exhibition.

 The artist found his attraction to surrealism in the works of Max Ernst and Hans Bellmer. “They lived through the World War I, and recognized the limits of the pursuit of rationalism”, Obana says. “They looked for clues to solves this predicament through the unconsciousness, much like Sigmund Freud”. Using technological advancement to his advantage, Obana embarks on a journey similar to Ernst and Bellmer trying to find answers in depth within. Obana’s works create the dialog not only between artist and viewer but also between the mind and body.

 An Israeli native, Zohar Wallach began her artistic practice after experiencing the dramatic landscape

 She got an art degree in Haifa University and over the years developed her unique style of work through applying layers of bio-paint, pigment and sand onto

 the canvas. Working with her hands, she modifies each layer by peeling and distressing it, while adding new pigment as she goes along. Marbled texture combinations emerge from the surface, mirroring the artist’s own methodical process. Each piece progress within several weeks, sometimes months as the different layers eventually dry to become a new denotation.

 change following her move to Canada in 1998.

 Evocation of the natural in her works vividly project a sense of space, depth and movement, presenting

 to the viewer reflections on the forces of the natural world.

 Exploring depth and substance she connects

 visual essentials through color, texture and form. The idea of capturing the essence of time leads Zohar towards wondering of each and every moment of life.

 Zohar’s works are being sought after by corporate and private collections all over the world. The artist resides in Calgary, Canada. Zohar has been exhibited throughout the Europe, Canada and US.

 Fernando Pomalaza is a native of Peru living in NY and doing collages in all media reflecting his culture.

 Maria Bernal is a Spanish young lady exploring works in oil, and print making.

<![CDATA[
Tabla Rasa Gallery presents FINE LINES, an exhibit of life drawings. Paul McDonough offers something magical: images that transport us beyond identifiable time and place, images that provoke questions of gender politics, a delicious visual seduction, all engendered from the simple act of skillfully touching pencil or pen to paper.

 Fellow artist and Co-director of Tabla Rasa, Audrey Anastasi says, “Working together as artists, off and on over the past 30 years, Paul and I have been “sharing models” for figure drawing sessions. We are both skilled at “observational” drawing; that is, capturing how something looks on paper, drawing it directly from life without the use of photographs. What you see on paper is unquestionably the subject matter before us. However, an interesting pattern emerged. Although both of our drawings were recognizable as the individual model, Paul’s drawings of the female nude showed soft, touchable women, clearly created from a different point of view than mine. As a woman, I was relating to the female form from the inside looking out, resulting in more angular, harder figures, who frequently made direct eye contact with the viewer.

 “As a gallerist, presenting Paul McDonough’s drawings of languid, romanticized female nudes, the question arises whether male-gaze, somewhat erotic depictions of women can legitimately exist in a culture striving for gender equality. Those of us reaching adulthood in the age of sexual revolution took for granted unprecedented personal freedom and open discourse. Politically, we are now getting a glimpse of the power of re-thinking, of how mores evolve, and of how repression can influence the way we experience art. The works are unabashedly sexual, but far less “sexualized” in intent than, for instance, a phantasmagorical Lisa Yuskavage painting of a female nude with wildly exaggerated breasts. Yet, Paul’s nudes are not coolly detached or clinical academic studies. His work is created of the moment, directly observed and devoid of agenda. Undeniably, the pencil marks and ink lines in McDonough’s drawings are as beautifully drawn and as sensual as the subjects themselves that he portrays.”

 ABOUT Paul McDonough and “In the Studio”

 Born in Portsmouth, NH, Paul McDonough was trained as an artist, studying drawing and painting with Nathan Goldstein at the New England School of Art in Boston. He was always attracted to the subject of the female nude, a time-honored tradition in Western art. When he moved to New York City in the late 1960’s, he literally stepped out of the studio and into the street where he photographed, not painted, the great, theatrical pageant of urban life. He also photographed nudes in the 1960’s and 1970’s, sporadically returning to the subject over the next few decades. But it wasn’t until 2004 when he built a studio above the top floor of his Brooklyn row house that his interest in the nude truly blossomed. He was able to blend his love of strong light with staged backgrounds that included references to his personal life, art history and fashion. Rather than being ancillary to the figures, the backdrops began to assume center stage, strong characters in their own right. The role of the nude evolved in the work from being the subject within a space to being a subject within a subject—the studio and the myriad objects that populated it. McDonough continues to draw these models in pen, pencil and charcoal, never fully letting go of his past training as a painter. The work contained in this volume shows an artist in full command of his many gifts; by now, it only seems natural that the studio has become his canvas and his world.

 McDonough has been the recipient of grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Guggenheim Foundation and the Pollock Krasner Foundation. His work is in a number of public and private collections including, the Museum of Modern Art, the New York Public Library, the DeCordova Museum, the Dreyfus Corporation, the Lila Acheson Wallace Print Collection and the Joseph Seagram’s Collection. He is represented by the Sasha Wolf Gallery in New York and the Joseph Bellows Gallery in La Jolla. This is the first public exhibition of his drawings.

<![CDATA[
On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the gallery, October 1968, Paula Cooper Gallery presents an exhibition of photographs by Peter Moore, the prolific visual historian of the avant-garde in the 1960s and 70s. Taken primarily in 1968, a year marked by seismic shifts in American politics, social movements, and an expanded notion of artistic practice, the images on view introduce the cultural landscape of New York in which Paula Cooper Gallery first opened. “Peter Moore: 1968” will be on view at 521 West 21st Street from October 6th to 27th, 2018. The show is presented alongside “50 Years: An Anniversary,” opening October 9th at the gallery’s new space on 26th Street.

 As a part of New York’s blossoming art community in the early 1960s, Moore (1932–1993) began what was to become an unmatched photographic archive of Fluxus, Judson Dance Theater, and countless “Happenings,” capturing in his photographs the defiance and spirit of the era’s experimental performances. Conceived in collaboration with Barbara Moore, this exhibition of vintage photographs, slides and ephemera from 1968 presents images of such iconic artists and performers as Trisha Brown, Steve Paxton, Charlotte Moorman, Nam June Paik, Simone Forti, Walter De Maria, La Monte Young, Robert Rauschenberg, Carolee Schneemann, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, Diane di Prima, Deborah Hay, Dick Higgins and Julian Beck. A series of rarely seen color images depict Stan VanDerBeek in his Movie Drome Theater in Stony Point, NY, a grain silo dome turned “infinite projection screen.” Other images show the first full-length performance of Yvonne Rainer’s The Mind Is a Muscle, arguably her most celebrated work; Thomas Hart Benton restoring his monumental, politically charged mural America Today (1930-31) at The New School; and several events from the 1968 Sixth Annual New York Avant Garde Festival.

 These precise black and white photographs capture scenes in Moore’s own distinctive style, a visual language that has become synonymous with performance art of this period: a use of space, the body, light, and fantastic props to create startling, unpredictable ambiance. In a 1974 interview Moore stated: “I have always dissociated myself completely from making any critical comment, consciously, in a photograph. I try to photograph documentarily … What you’re trying to do is to do justice, as much as you are able to, to the intent of the artist, rather than impose your own point of view … [But] essentially I am still limited to photographing my reaction to the rhythm of the piece. I am selecting the instance primarily on that basis; so I can’t get rid of myself altogether.” Fifty years after these ephemeral events, Moore’s photographs present a pivotal history of artists at the forefront of avant-garde experimentation and those iconic spaces, including 80 Wooster Street, Caffe Cino, and Midsummer, NY, where performance, music, dance and visual art intersected in radical and transformative ways.

 Born in London, Moore (1932-1993) attended Haverford College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He began his career in New York as a photo lab technician at Life magazine and an assistant to O. Winston Link. In the 1970s and 80s, Moore wrote prolifically on the mechanics of photography, including as Technical Editor, and then as Senior Technical Editor at Modern Photography magazine (1978-89). His work was included in the 1970 show “Happenings and Fluxus” at the Kölnischer Kunstverein in Cologne, Germany; “Alternative Gestures: Another Look at Dance Photography” at P.S. 1, Long Island City, New York (1978); the Fluxus pavilion at the 1990 Venice Biennale; “In the Spirit of Fluxus” at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis (1993); the 2nd Lyon Biennale (1993); “Art, Lies and Videotape” at Tate Liverpool (2003); “Simone Forti. Thinking with the Body: A Retrospective in Motion” at the Museum der Moderne in Salzburg (2014); “The City Lost and Found: Capturing New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles: 1960-1980” at the Art Institute of Chicago (2014-15); and the 14th Lyon Biennale (2017), among many others. He has had one-person exhibitions around the world, including Ecart, Geneva, Switzerland (1980); Gallery 360º, Tokyo, Japan (1989); Galerie Alfred Kren, Cologne, Germany (“The Avant-Garde Observed,” 1990); Sonnabend Gallery, New York (2004); and several one-person shows at Paula Cooper Gallery, New York (2009, 2011, 2015, 2018).

 Currently a large selection of Moore’s photographs are on view at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in the exhibition “Judson Dance Theater: The Work Is Never Done” through February 3, 2019. His images have been widely published in texts about the period, including Democracy’s Body: Judson Dance Theater, 1962-1964 (1983), In the Spirit of Fluxus (1993), Yvonne Rainer: Radical Juxtapositions 1961-2002 (2002), and Critical Mass: Happenings, Fluxus, Performance, Intermedia and Rutgers University 1958-1972 (2003); among others. In 2000, D.A.P. published The Destruction of Penn Station, which presented Moore’s previously unseen documentation of New York’s Pennsylvania Station demolition.

M E N presents Black Henbane, an exhibition by Hoboken-based artist Rob Ventura. In his New York City solo debut, Ventura continues his explorations of poisonous flowers as a visual motif for painting, drawing, and sculpture.

 Hyoscyamus niger, commonly known as black henbane, is a highly toxic plant that has been historically used in the mixture of poisons, medicinal potions, and psychoactive hallucinogens. For this exhibition, Ventura displays various abstract representations of the anatomical and cellular structure of the flower, while exploring its cultural significance as a plant purportedly used to concoct “magic brews”.

 The works on view incorporate oil paint, oil pastel, charcoal, ceramic, and colored pencil. The imagery varies, including poetic interpretations of floral still-life, botanical illustrations, cell diagrams, and micro photography.

 Ventura investigates the fields of phytomorphology, the study of the physical and external form of plants, and phytotomy, the study of the interior structure of plants at the cellular level. This interplay between exterior and interior forms metaphorically reflects the psychoanalytic relation of the conscious to the unconscious.

Ethan Cohen presents Art History X, the first solo exhibition of Jeffrey Hargrave at the gallery.

 Ethan Cohen Gallery is pleased to announce the first solo exhibition of Jeffrey Spencer Hargrave with the gallery, entitled ART HISTORY X. The show highlights Hargrave’s body of work made between 2015 and 2018 where the artist reimagines the canon of art history in the context of sexuality, identity, and today’s fraught racial divides. Through the use of satire, references to African heritage and the trauma of slavery, Hargrave creates artworks that explore the current socio-political state of xenophobia, the global rise of far right-wingers, and the familiar 20th century rhetoric of nationalism and separation.

 Hargrave addresses the major issues of our time using intimate and humorous vehicles like his works on paper, recycled household objects and more recently mid-size canvases, in which he deconstructs such modern masters as Matisse, Modigliani, Manet and others of their ilk. His series Phallic Politics posits the perspective “the other” as implicit witness and consists of authentic posters from China’s Cultural Revolution covered with cartoonish characters frequently used in the visual vocabulary of the artist. In other works, themes of pleasure, sexuality and urban life style are depicted in the Ukiyo-e stylized works on paper and canvas created in the artist’s studio in Harlem where he has been based since 2013.

 Hargrave’s work speaks to the world but through a visual language deconstructed and reshaped by the artist’s emotional experience of isolation and yearning for identity, as he taps into his own memories of growing up in the midst of a sharply divided community. Hargrave translates his personal experiences into playful, yet biting images that mix art-history clichés and racial stereotypes. Ultimately, the artist asks us to consider a ‘What If’ in which the missing persona – himself and his kind – is included in the picture.

 Jeffrey Hargrave attended the University of the North Carolina School of the Arts, Rhode Island School of Design, and Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. His works have been exhibited at the Bronx Museum of the Arts, Art Miami, Contemporary Istanbul, KuBe Beacon, VOLTA Basel and other important platforms for cultural exchange and engagement.

Team (gallery, inc.) presents an installation by the Norwegian-born, Tokyo-based artist Gardar Eide Einarsson.

 In November of 2016, Hillary Clinton was widely presumed to be the frontrunner in the American presidential election. During the early morning hours of the ninth, however, it became clear that her opponent would be declared the victor. Shortly before the election, Team Gallery had opened a solo show by Gardar Eide Einarsson at its project space on the West Coast. Included in that exhibition was a work entitled Flagwaste, a substantial sculpture that consists of remnants from the production of American flags. The materials had been obtained directly from U.S. factories, the residual waste of the flags’ fabrication process. The factories contacted were asked simply to sweep the floors at close of day, box the refuse and ship them to the gallery. The red, white and blue material was displayed as a giant, contiguous mound in the center of one of the gallery’s spaces.
 As the elections of 2018 loom, Einarsson has chosen to re-fashion Flagwaste as a solo exhibition for New York City. At Team’s Grand Street space, the sculpture will be shown in a scattered, as opposed to a piled, orientation. Flagwaste creates of the gallery a site for concern, a site for mourning, and makes palpable the radical and transgressive nature of the minimalist enterprise.

 The work refers explicitly to Robert Morris’ Untitled (Threadwaste) from 1968; the latter piece - an amorphous mass of industrial thread, the refuse from textile manufacturing, interspersed with bits of felt, mirrors, asphalt and copper tubing - is a seminal example of late Minimalism, and questions the cultural relegation of certain materials as refuse. Einarsson extends this logic to provide a metaphor for the necessary role of exclusion to the construction and definition of the nation state.

 Commandeering minimalist form for political ends is second-nature to Einarsson and his selection of Morris incontrovertible. Mating an apparently blank form to a charged gesture, Flagwaste began first as reduction: the removal of the artist’s hand, replaced by instructions executed by gallery staff. His act of appropriation is also marked by a pruning, for example, the aestheticizing mirrors incorporated by Morris in his pile of “rubbish” are nowhere to be seen in the Einarsson. In this way Flagwaste offers a correction to Threadwaste, removing its unnecessary excess gestures.
 This is Einarsson’s seventh solo show with Team. He has been the subject of solo museum exhibitions at the Fridericianum in Kassel, the Kunstverein Frankfurt, the Astrup-Fearnly in Oslo, the Contemporary Art Museum in St. Louis, the Centre d’Art Contemporain in Geneva, the Rekjavik Art Museum, The Modern Art Museum in Fort Worth, the Bonniers Konsthall in Stockholm and the ARos Aarhus Kunstmuseum. Einarsson’s work is represented in numerous public collections including the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, MoMA in New York, SFMoMA, LACMA and Frankfurt’s Museum für Moderne Kunst.

 Team will also inaugurate a series of projects in a space we refer to internally as Gallery B. These small shows will focus on artists who are not a part of the gallery’s program and will be organized with little lead time. First up are TARWUK, a Brooklyn-based duo who will be represented by two oil paintings and a sculpture. Raised in Croatia, Bruno Pogacnik Wukodrakula and Ivana Vuksic, have been working together since 2014.

Viridian Artists presents a retrospective of works by Bob Tomlinson.

 There are two kinds of artists, a Picasso who is constantly changing his style and a Balthus who is relatively stylistically stable. The first case does not exclude recurrent themes and a recognizable mark, nor does the second

exclude a subtle stylistic evolution. Tomlinson’s art is somewhere between the two. One of the joys of a retrospective is that it allows both the viewer and the artist to reflect on recurrent elements and themes in the work.

 In Tomlinson’s art, it is not far-fetched to see echoes of the early woodcuts in the graphic style of his later works. His abstract collages prepare the viewer for the collage passages of the later oil and collage paintings. Beyond variations of style and media, in Tomlinson’s paintings there is an ongoing concern with the human body as the primary expressive tool. Faces are turned away and except for the portraits, we seldom see the eyes. Ignoring the traditional distinction between naturalistically depicted figures and abstract forms, the sensuous color and bold, sinuous contours of this artist’s elusive and lyrical paintings play on the tension between figurative references and abstracted shapes.

 Tomlinson is a Jamaican-American artist born in Brooklyn, New York. He has shown widely in Paris, London, Amsterdam and New York and is represented in many international public and private collections including those of the Clark-Atlanta University Museum, City University of New York, the late Dr. Maya Angelou, Sir Shean McConnell, Lord and Lady Hirshfield, Sr. Franco Trecanni, Mme Linda Weil-Curiel and Herr Frits Bernard.

 A graduate of Pratt Institute and the CUNY Graduate Center, Tomlinson is also a scholar of French Literature and Aesthetics and has lectured and published in both disciplines, as well as in Afro-American Studies. He figures in the books, 100 New York Painters by Cynthia M. Dantzic (Schiffer, 2006) and Black Paris Profiles by Monique E. Wells (2012) and is one of the artists studied in a recent Masters Thesis by Charlotte Barat, Artistes Noirs Américains à Paris (1945-1969), (Université de Paris I, Panthéon- Sorbonne, 2014). He is also the subject of a film project by well-known documentary filmmaker Louis Massiah.

The SMET group is beginning construction of their new rail lines, however the Insectoids have become a liability to their transit expansion plans. The SMET group forms CTON, an anti-insect task force subsidiary. Stage 1 of the CTON initiative is to start misting their newly developed PX-Sprëj, a repellent specially formulated to exterminate the Insectoids.

 Using installation, video, painting, and sculpture, Arvid Logan pieces together an alternate world that pulls from the imagery of his childhood. Logan re-imagines the conflicts of living in an increasingly privatized and authoritative city as a war between insects and exterminators.

Sofía Córdova’s first exhibition at this gallery, A las mil maravillas / In the Thousand Wonders, introduces her vision of an imminent climate-induced apocalypse through video, sound, sculpture, and photography. By shortening the distance between speculation and documentation, Córdova creates a poignant, grounding response to the problem of the future.

 The central work in the exhibition is a long form two-channel video, dawn_chorus ii: el niagra en bicicleta, filmed by Córdova in her native Puerto Rico over the last two years. Returning to the island following Hurricane Maria, Córdova completed the work by incorporating interviews she conducted with family and friends alongside records culled from her late grandfather’s salsa collection.

 This exhibition, also the artist’s first in New York, continues Córdova’s ongoing interest in science fiction as a tool for survival. She reimagines tropes of ecological collapse by looking to Afro-Caribbean syncretic religions and dance music as diasporic documents of resilience, tethering both past and present to a future still in the making.

 Sofía Córdova (USA, b. 1985 in Carolina, Puerto Rico) received her BFA from St. John’s University and her MFA from California College of the Arts. Córdova has held solo exhibitions at Kate Werble Gallery, New York, NY (forthcoming 2018); ASU Art Museum Project Space, Tempe, AZ (2017); City Limits Gallery, Oakland, CA (2017); Pro Arts, Oakland, CA (2015); Royal Nonesuch Gallery, Oakland, CA (2014); and PlaySpace Gallery, San Francisco, CA (2011). Her work has been exhibited at venues including Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco, CA; Torrance Art Museum, Torrance, CA; Mills College Museum of Art, Oakland, CA; Contemporary Jewish Museum, San Francisco, CA; Abrons Arts Center, New York, NY; MEWO Kunsthalle, Memmingen, Germany; San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art, San Jose, CA; SFMOMA, San Francisco, CA; Sonoma Museum of Art, Sonoma, CA; and the International Center for Photography, New York, NY. She currently lives and works in Oakland, CA.

Curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist, Gabriela Rangel, and Asad Raza

 The official stories of national, ethnic, and historic identity are no longer convincing—today, these constructs have been fatally weakened by an array of turbulent forces that have led us to choose between an exploitative globalization process and an imaginary ethno-cultural purity. Trembling Thinking seeks another path by looking back at two figures from the Caribbean archipelago, who anticipated these conditions: Lydia Cabrera (Havana, 1899–Miami, 1991) and Édouard Glissant (Sainte-Marie, Martinique, 1928–Paris, 2011).

 Glissant points to the importance of global dialogues in which local differences are not negated but produced. His works have such urgency to prevent the stagnation of cultural homogenization. His critique of isolation and fundamentalism is something that he shares with Cabrera, who built bridges between cultures and disciplines. Cabrera critiqued the fetishization of decontextualized African art and artifacts among the Parisian elite. As a translator, she encouraged solidarity between preeminent thinkers such as Aimé Césaire and Wifredo Lam.

 For Cabrera and Glissant, thinking beyond narrow understandings of identities was a necessity. Glissant emphasized always something unknowable—something opaque—inside each person, which rather than dividing us links us. This opacity must be defended vigorously in our own time, when we face a constant drive to discern and diagnose, to know with certainty. Cabrera and Glissant crossed another rigid barrier of our time: the multiple fences dividing poetry, philosophy, truth, and fiction. To maintain an open and subjective relation to the world, the refusal to systematize thinking unites Cabrera and Glissant, bringing them in relation to each other. A thought that trembles refuses to be definitively located, to be one. Rather, it shakes, vibrates, and stays multiple, leaving its identity indefinable.

 Glissant and Cabrera’s influence is projected through works of modern and contemporary artists documented in archival material: photographs, first editions by Cabrera and Aimé Césaire, letters to Cabrera from Roger Caillois, Pierre Verger, and María Zambrano, and notebooks and drawings by Cabrera and Glissant.

 The exhibition is accompanied by a pocket book with an essay by curators Hans Ulrich Obrist, Gabriela Rangel, and Asad Raza as well as a publication, Lydia Cabrera, between the sum and the parts (edited by Karen Marta and Gabriela Rangel) with texts by Hans Ulrich Obrist, Gabriela Rangel, Martin Tsang, and Christopher Winks.

 Lydia Cabrera and Édouard Glissant: Trembling Thinking is organized in partnership with the Cuban Heritage Collection of the University of Miami Libraries.

 It is made possible by an award from the National Endowment for the Arts, and by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in partnership with the City Council.

A Benefit Exhibition for March For Our Lives

 “50 Years: An Anniversary” celebrates the October 1968 opening of the Paula Cooper Gallery, the first art gallery in SoHo at 96-100 Prince Street. The inaugural exhibition, organized by Robert Huot, Lucy Lippard and Ron Wolin, benefitted the Student Mobilization Committee To End The War In Vietnam and Veterans Against The War In Vietnam. The fiftieth anniversary show will include artworks from that time period by the original artists: Carl Andre, Jo Baer, Robert Barry, Bill Bollinger, Dan Flavin, Robert Huot, Will Insley, Donald Judd, Sol LeWitt, Robert Mangold, Robert Murray, Doug Ohlson, and Robert Ryman.

 The cohesive and pioneering 1968 Benefit exhibition holds enduring potency as an exploration of non-objective Conceptual art, and of art as a form of political activism. On view in “50 Years: An Anniversary” will be exemplary works including Sol LeWitt’s first wall drawing, Wall Drawing 1: Drawing Series II 14 (A &amp; B)—now in the collection of SFMOMA—first executed for the gallery’s inaugural show. With its succinct and straightforward directive of “lines in four directions—vertical, horizontal, and the two diagonals,” the seminal 1968 work was revelatory in its frank temporality, disregard for issues of commercial viability, and denial of authorial exclusivity for a handmade artwork. A diptych by Jo Baer entitled Untitled (Vertical Flanking Diptych - Green), 1966-1974, contemporaneous to her work from the 1968 Benefit show, reflects Baer’s ardent agenda: “There is no hierarchy. There is no ambiguity. There is no illusion. There is no space or interval (time).”1 Also on view will be Carl Andre’s original 1968 work, composed of twenty-eight found bricks laid end-to-end directly on the floor, which challenged traditional conceptions of material, labor and value.

 In keeping with the intention of the inaugural exhibition as a “forceful statement for peace”—as well as the gallery’s subsequent decades of political engagement—the anniversary show will be a benefit exhibition in support of March For Our Lives. Founded in early 2018, March For Our Lives is dedicated to student-led activism around ending gun violence and the epidemic of mass shootings. As a synthesis of the radical political and aesthetic shifts that were emerging in the world at that time, the 1968 exhibition bears resonance in our contemporary landscape. “50 YEARS: An Anniversary” aims to reexamine and recommit to those appeals for national change.

 On view through November 3, 2018, the exhibition marks the first presentation at the gallery’s new location at 524 West 26th Street. The temporary relocation continues a dynamic narrative in the fifty-year history of the gallery, having occupied several spaces first in SoHo from 1968 to 1996 and then in Chelsea from 1996 to the present, through expansions, relocations, and special presentations.

FORMS AND COLORS CONTINUED/ COLOR AND SCALE marks Sophia Vari’s fifteenth solo exhibition with Nohra Haime Gallery. Throughout her long and internationally spread career, Vari’s work continues to take dramatic turns. Ranging from monumental sculpture to canvases, geometric collages and wearable jewelry, her work retains a signature strong yet sensitive, recognizable hand. This exhibition gathers work in multiple mediums, and includes new sculptures and collages highlighting powerful explorations into color and scale.

 Vari’s work emerges as a reflection of herself through aspects of a multicultural upbringing. Her worldly experience and valuable education greatly influence the progression of her art. Born in Greece in 1940 to a Greek father and Hungarian mother, Vari spent her early childhood in Lausanne, Switzerland. Upon returning to Greece after the war, Vari had a distinct relationship with French culture. Additionally, her many years in Paris, ties to South and Central America, and extensive foreign travel have amalgamated into a uniquely personal style.

 An active artist since the 60s, Vari’s shift from painting to sculpture marked the first of many significant advancements in her career. She quickly discovered that making art which existed in a 3D space satisfied a deep seeded need within her. The simplified, essential form of Cycladic sculpture from her native country of Greece provided a strong influence during her primal artistic stages. After mastering the use of bronze and epoxy, her shapes took on a less representative form, yet retained a recognizably feminine essence.

 Vari’s most recent major development explores the use of color and scale. In this exhibition are sculptural and collage examples showcasing her skillful flow of color from 2D to 3D works. Sometimes bold, sometimes subtle, her carefully considered color palette emphasizes the edges of her ascending polychrome sculptures and artful works on wood.

 From her tabletop pieces to monumental public sculpture, Vari’s dramatic play with scale is evident across all mediums. Her mural-sized collage, Forms and Colors 3, supplies us with a sense of how scale changes the experience for the viewer within 2D. These bold compositions come to fruition utilizing details of watercolor, gouache, paper and wood. Through the use of diptychs and triptychs, they generate an all-encompassing feeling for the viewer.

 Sophia Vari is currently based in Montecarlo. She studied at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, France. Vari has a strong international presence and has participated in hundreds of solo and group exhibitions across Europe, the United States, and Asia. Outdoor solo exhibitions of Vari’s monumental sculptures have taken place in cities such as Paris, Rome, Montecarlo, Baden-Baden, Geneva, Pietrasanta, Athens, Madrid, and Cartagena de Indias. These monumental works are currently on view at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Center in Athens. Her art is included in the permanent collection of a multitude of museums and institutions. Danseuse Espagnole graces the Plaza of the Heroines at Wichita State University in Kansas. Vari has been represented by Nohra Haime Gallery since 1985.

Walls and Floors presents seven years of materials mobilized in Yve Laris Cohen’s previous works.

 Exhibited is every floor or wall currently in the artist’s personal storage.

 In Duet..(2011), a narrow sprung dance floor supported several hundred tours jetés.

 In Duet with Thomas von Foerster (2011), the marley from the Duet.. floor was supposed to be repurposed, but it was stolen from the curb during load-in.

 In Coda (2012), an over-sprung dance floor performed as a wall.

 In Waltz; (2012) and its performances Hesitation Change, Drag Hesitation, and Cross Hesitation, slabs of aluminum track and studs, drywall, joint compound, and corner bead performed as both floors and surplus wall.

 In Landing Field (2013), wall slabs built according to Laris Cohen’s and Vito Acconci’s eye levels enclosed a museum gallery and required attention from the fire marshal.

 In D.S. (2014) and its attending performance al Coda, a Landing Field wall was repurposed as, alternately, an insured art object and uninsured performance prop.

 In D.C. (2014), the second Landing Field wall performed as a plinth, supporting David Horvitz sculptures.

 In Meeting Ground (2018), salvaged wooden walls from a demolished museum auditorium were reconstituted.

 Walls and Floors marks the inaugural exhibition at Company Gallery’s second space, baby Company.

Van Doren Waxter presents Harvey Quaytman: Rockers and Pendulums, 1969-1977, a self-professed “classical modernist”, helped to reshape the trajectory of American painting in the 1960s and 1970s with his monumental shaped canvases and is acknowledged for moving abstract painting into a more sculptural direction.

 The curated gallery exhibition, which will include public programming on the artist’s legacy and influence, coincides with the artist’s first full-scale museum retrospective (October 17, 2018-January 27, 2019) at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (BAMPFA), CA organized by Apsara DiQuinzio. The highly anticipated survey is accompanied by the most in-depth scholarship to date edited by DiQuinzio (UC Press, 2018), examining the artist’s groundbreaking body of work and formal interests in shape, color, line, pattern, and surface.

 The gallery show of six paintings and four works on paper, some of which have rarely been exhibited or reproduced, examines the period following Quaytman’s early exploration of Abstract Expressionism. Having moved from Cambridge, MA where he attended the School of the Museum of Fine Arts and Tufts University, to New York City in 1964, he began to isolate the curvilinear line from earlier work incorporating it into hand-built stretchers of shaped parts balanced one upon the other or attached in tandem to one another. The artist would begin a lifelong experiment with color during this time, and the works evince a range of chromatic effects. Untitled, 1971 is a painting of extraordinary scale (50 x 136 inches) and color in two parts: the shield form painted with wall paper brushes in cobalt blue creating a rough-hewn surface peppered with lumps of pigment delicately situated on points of the separate but attached supporting cradle. The curve of the shield is not symmetrical emphasizing the objectness or otherness of the forms starkly protruding from the wall.

 The arc or curve was key to the artist’s intention of creating movement in a static object. The four pendulum paintings in the exhibition are defined by a long neck ending in a foot that seems to set the painting in motion. The tops of the paintings have a perspectival folly implying volume. But as the eye travels to the foot of the painting the surface flattens out. These paintings are ingeniously composed of two forms, painted separately but whose gesture unites them as one. The artist has layered and scraped the surfaces with pigment suspended in Rhoplex with the intention of hiding nothing.

 For Quaytman, working on paper was an eventual route to a more scultptural practice. The works on paper in the exhibition are both painted and drawn toggling between intense color and black and white. The painted rocker drawings display careful attention to the edge of the image, which is taped to allow a build-up of layers of paint emphasizing the physical presence of the image on the page. The pendulum drawings, noteworthy for their proximity to human scale, tell a different story. Quaytman uses drawing in charcoal to define a tilted rectangle. Within that form emerges the finished form of the irregularly shaped pendulum paintings. The drawings are mad with balsa wood to give the line a subtle bas relief.

 In the artist’s words: ‘My paintings mean to me my victory, inch by inch and year by year, over the arbitrary chaos of visual life. I have slowly taken command of a way of ordering my composition so that with the slightest shift of shaped colored areas I can break symmetry or stasis or even death. My meaning resides in my own victory over the inert.’

 One of Quaytman’s daughters and an artist in her own right, R.H Quaytman, has contributed an essay to the new, scholarly catalog accompanying her father’s first posthumous museum retrospective.

 “+ x, Chapter 34” will be presented at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in conjunction with Hilma af Klint: Paintings for the Future, at the same time as her father Harvey Quaytman’s New York gallery presentation and BAMPFA exhibition. R.H. Quaytman discovered af Klint in 1988 after her father, returning from a trip to Sweden, presented her with a small catalog of the artist’s work.

 Born in Queens, NY to Polish-Russian Jewish immigrants, Harvey Quaytman (1937-2002) has had more than sixty solo gallery exhibitions in different parts of the world including New York, Los Angeles, London, Berlin, Cologne, Paris, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Oslo. He is represented in many museum collections worldwide such as the Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, PA; Harvard Art Museums, Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA; Houston Museum of Fine Arts, Texas; The Israel Museum, Jerusalem; Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebaek, Denmark; Museum of Modern Art, New York; the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra; Phillips Collection, Washington, DC; Tate Gallery, London, England; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, CT.

<![CDATA[
James Fuentes presents Didier William’s exhibition Curtains, Stages, and Shadows, a dual exhibition presented in conjunction with Anna Zorina Gallery.

 Didier William’s most recent body of work, Curtains, Stages, and Shadows — as well as the title of this exhibition — explores the relationship between the formal tensions and the narrative capacities of painting. A series of large-scale mixed-media paintings replete with bold decorative patterns and cut through eye-shaped forms insist on a beauty and a sensuality that is almost audible and in the realm of the haptic. The titles of the pieces appear in Haitian Kreyòl, unapologetically, with no English translations or subtitles. Inspired by memories of growing up in a resilient yet vulnerable Haitian community in Miami and coming of age when black and brown immigrant bodies have come to symbolize precarious living, William created these mixed-media pieces as pictorial rather than narrative. As with most of his works, the body takes center stage, literally and figuratively. For William, the recurring motif of the stage evokes the unsettled sensation of immigrant life in the diaspora. There is always a performance to be “Black”, a performance to be “West Indian” or “Caribbean,” and a performance to pale angle kòrèkteman. Consequently, for Kreyòl-speaking immigrant people, Blackness, Caribbeanness, and language competence are cultural markers that are in constant negotiation to determine belonging. The paintings highlight a deep sense of vulnerability, yet their aestheticization is marked by a desire for deeper and more complex thinking of how to transcend such vulnerability and become inherently provocative.

 There is a tension in the works: a certain yearning to go against the constructs of the limiting everyday coupled with a hopefulness that longs for a different possible future. In Nou Tout Ansamn, the urban eccentric landscape of the global Caribbean city that is Miami coalesces within the familiar conventionality of painting. The black and blue curtains that descend over the suspended bodies are reminiscent, for William, of the blue plastic tarps that covered the booths of Ti Mache, an outdoor flea market held in Opa-locka, Miami Dade County. The booths were operated by Haitian men and women who sold sundries and food goods that they had procured from Haiti. Ti Mache, William remembers, was a space that was “packed with Haitians at their most Haitian. Nobody was trying to acquiesce to anything or change their behavior…a place where everyone spoke Kreyòl.” While this sense of community and of a shared identity is suggested in the title of the piece, the groundlessness of the bodies reminds the viewer of the destabilizing and precarious nature of immigrant living. An imprecise shadow of the figure graces the stage floor, hinting to the presence of unrecognizable bodies teetering between an untethered space where light is obstructed by an opaque object. Images of machetes grouped together form a decorative configuration in the background, perhaps alluding to a vanishing tradition of tire machèt, a martial art still practiced in parts of Haiti. Drawing on personal memories, William visually articulates the complex social dynamics of contemporary immigrant urban living.

 Ou ap tonbe, men m ap kenbe ou displays a curtain fashioned in abstract shapes with vibrant reds, oranges, yellows, greens, and blues. A standing figure balances preciously on the edge of the stage; a kneeling figure braces the figure with a hand. Our eyes are forced to look at bodies at odd angles that bend, float, and stand straight while swirling carved lines form borders around these vibrating bodies. Through compositions like these, William creates a metaphoric language out of images. There is a deliberate intention to fashion the body into a language, so that its corporeality speaks a language that references both medical anatomy and art history. While there is no clear narrative visible in the works, we have instead beautiful allegories pregnant with memories long forgotten and stories never spoken. Look closely at the kaleidoscope-patterned curtains and at the shadows on the stage and you will see their refusal to be hidden, to proclaim their existence and offer an aesthetic refusal and resistance to silence and absence.

 These compelling works reconfigure the dynamics of the gaze. The cut-through eye-shaped muscular figures embody the authoritative tensions among looking at, being looked at, and looking back, intrepidly shifting the subject/object power dynamic. They encourage an active seeing experience, one that reveals the struggles that are tirelessly fought by those who live courageously at the margin and who constantly attempt to obliterate those boundaries. Moreover, the looking at/back experience is not simply occurring on the part of the viewer. Explicitly, by their presence, these eye-shaped bodies bestow upon the viewer a cross between a defiant look and a dismissive seeing, one that Haitians refer to as kout je: a sharp side-eye that at its boldest and most direct evokes the presence of bodies that were denied the right to look back.

 These paintings draw our attention to the provocative interstices made by the encounters among distinctive shapes, lines, forms, and colors. Thus, the method of looking is different. It needs to be decidedly haptic. It needs to be deliberately engaging. It needs to be mindful of the resonances created at the points of encounter between the composition of painting, the materiality of printmaking, and the precision of drawing. It is in this context that we can understand William’s work. The paintings capture the essence of power, sensuality, and presence while not shying away from the challenges hidden in the shadows.

 These non-gendered, non-racialized bodies strikingly document an almost intuitive sense of resilience and profundity, visualizing universal elements of the human condition that are without regard for race, sexuality orientation, or gender identity. We may be mesmerized by the beauty of their sensuous shape, but we are also transfixed by their shadows as they appear on the vividly-colored and patterned curtains, share the stage, and dwell on the ornate, painterly abstract backgrounds. Sinewy lines, seemingly frenetic curvilinear marks, guide our eyes to the ways in which William balances suggestive abstract sensibilities with expressive organic qualities. It is in this context that William’s recent work captivates us, through the haptic that suggests movement, color, form, and, most importantly, a harmonious sensuality. His mixed-media works possess a compositional logic that examines how painting and printmaking energetically coalesce on the surfaces of the panels. In these decidedly detailed-oriented works, William explores the role of painting and printmaking as processes that intertwine the hand with the mechanical. We can almost feel the reverence for the materiality generated by vivid areas of color and a meticulousness of line. This cross-disciplinary expertise allows the viewer to relish in his deft control and skill in emotive mark making. The works gathered in this exhibition provide further demonstration of the wonder and ingenuity of William’s unique visual harmony and compositional dynamism.

 This exhibition essay was written by Jerry Philogene, Ph. D., Associate Professor in the American Studies Department at Dickinson College, Pennsylvania.

Kasmin presents Barbary, a new body of large-scale watercolors by Walton Ford that will inaugurate the gallery’s flagship space in Chelsea, New York. The series is a result of over eighteen years of research by Ford into the iconic Barbary lion. This subspecies—the subject of a long, ongoing cultural fascination—historically ranged across the Atlas Mountains of North Africa, but has been extinct in the wild since the early 20th century after over 2000 years of persecution. The Barbary lion is the lion of the Roman amphitheater, the lion painted by Delacroix, and the lion that roars for the Hollywood film studio MGM.

SHFAP presents two exhibitions in October. In our front gallery, we present OFFSPRING, an exhibition of recent paintings by Sangram Majumdar.

 In this new body of work, Majumdar returns to working with the figure as a primary motif. These paintings and works on paper evolve Majumdar’s interest in exploring the hidden, the peripheral, and the in-between. They purposely resist direct interpretation, inviting us to slow down, embrace ambiguity, and trust our senses.

 The works began as much by trying to give form to the political anxiety in this country as by watching his daughter learn to walk. This striding gesture reminds one of ancient sculptures, Muybridge’s photographs, Giacometti’s sculptures or DON’T WALK signs.

 Majumdar’s new paintings are built from drawings, and collages made from watching bits of home videos. He works intuitively, revising entire paintings multiple times. This process lends his works a tangible sense of simultaneity. Frequently he employs conventions from the representational and abstract modes of painting in eastern and western art. He is working to synthesize his own complex relationship with history and a renewed investment in figuration, both symbolic and personal.

 This is Majumdar’s fourth solo exhibition at Steven Harvey Fine Art Projects. In the course of that, he has traversed a broad pictorial range, from highly accomplished representational paintings to increasingly abstract images all the while grounded in direct observation. John Yau wrote about Majumdar’s work, “It seems to me that Majumdar is after that moment of seeing which occurs just before we name the object, event or experience and begin looking for the next thing, whatever it is… I see this as a risky gambit as well as a conscious challenge to a media-besotted world that revels in names and naming, as if somehow everything can be accounted for, safely categorized and subsequently copied.”

 Majumdar has been a Professor of Painting at the Maryland Institute College of Art since 2003. In 2017, he had a survey exhibition at Asia Society Texas Center in Houston, Texas.

 In our rear gallery, we present new and ­­earlier paintings by Kurt Knobelsdorf, in an exhibition titled CIVITA.

 Civita is a tiny Italian village where Knobelsdorf taught painting last summer. His new landscapes veer between this vertiginous ancient village and the decaying architecture of North Philadelphia where he recently set up his studio.

 The buildings Knobelsdorf paints in Philadelphia twist and curve like Soutine’s houses. Their organic aspect links them to his overgrown Italian roads. In fact Knobelsdorf is a kind of scholar of the road. His paintings appear as though they might contain earth from landscape he paints. There is a ferocious touch and acuity to his descriptive painting. No niceties are taken. Description is summary, thickly built up, yet highly articulated.

 Knobelsdorf has worked peripatetically from Florida to Philadelphia, from Detroit to Israel and Italy. Simultaneously, he explores the wide open landscape of the popular imagination. He is a channeler of images, working both with found sources and from nature.

 In 2014, his work was included in the 2014 Invitational Exhibition of Visual Arts at The American Academy of Arts and Letters, where he received an award and a museum purchase prize sending two works to the Woodmere Museum near Philadelphia.

 The most important collection of his work resides in the William Louis-Dreyfus Foundation. Dreyfus collected over twenty of Knobelsdorf’s small panels. William Benton writes about Knobelsdorf in “Eye Contact,” a new collection of his art criticism, “The pictures are small, the size of a Ryder, and as eccentric. They resemble outsider work, but are too skillfully made to be thought of in that way, too alert to the stresses and poise of their originality.”

“… great tactile beauty” …
 a “fusion of a minimalist aesthetic with an exquisite sense of refinement.”
 —The Morgan Library and Museum, Modern and Contemporary Drawings


 Anita Rogers Gallery presents Gloria Ortiz-Hernández: Drawings and Sculptures.

 Critic and curator Gregory Volk has written of her earlier work that “…the effect on the viewer is liberating and open-ended. Some kind of border between the known and unknown is being traversed. One thinks of half-formed longings and supple desires, of passion and loss, of ingrained sadness and spiritually wise acceptance.”

 Ortiz-Hernández has spent decades exploring light and darkness, diffusion and form. Of her process and approach, she writes:

 “There is no ‘story’ in this work, no reliance on nature, no human figure. The source is from within. Each gesture, each mark, has to be sought, each form to be discovered. Through unwavering attention, the artist begins to see, to abandon familiar notions, to accept—without hindrance and free of prejudice—the image as it comes. Because doubt is always present and false starts happen, the work is made slowly. While the attention of the artist is tightly engaged with the emerging purpose of the drawing, the materials speak as well. Materials help establish the image, they give it form and, in doing so, afford substance to the feeling and speak for it. Fine powdered materials such as pigment and charcoal delight when they ‘fly’ and fall on to the paper, suggesting their own displacement. The density and creamy consistency of oil pastel, on the other hand, demands absolute meticulousness because both during and after application it remains wet and slippery. The pencil, a frank and simple instrument, is capable of creating complex, deep, and dark tones that surprise and instruct. It is an irreplaceable instrument.

 In a drawing, the support (the paper) must offer the adequate surface and the precise size that corresponds to the weight and force of the image. Misjudging the size and weight of the paper will distort the content, rendering it either too strong or too weak. Although the materials and the support are at the service of the drawing, they also have an identity of their own, complete and autonomous. Nonetheless, it is important that they surrender this identity when necessary, that they sacrifice themselves to the work. Only when they function in harmony do they make the content clear and unambiguous to the artist, and, later on, to the viewer. “In the act of working on a drawing or a sculpture, the gesture is short, defined, and austere. Darkness and its counterpoint, extreme light, are often present. The marks are economical and straightforward: they expand without exaggerating; they do not preen, preach, or pretend; they persuade without argument, and reduce without diminishing.”

 Colombian-born Ortiz-Hernández’s drawings and sculptures have been shown in numerous solo and group exhibitions. Her work is in the permanent collections of a number of institutions, including The Museum of Modern Art (NY), The Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University (MA), Art Museums Cambridge (MA), The Morgan Library and Museum (NY), The Menil Drawing Institute and Study Center (TX), and The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MA). Her work is also in private collections throughout the United States and in Basel, Switzerland; Sao Paolo, Brazil; and Bogotá, Colombia.

MILES MCENERY GALLERY presents an exhibition of works by Beverly Fishman.

 Beverly Fishman’s bold, polychromatic wall works meditate on the many parallels that can be drawn between pharmaceuticals and art. Like taking a pill, an experience with art is often brief yet has the ability to induce a response that runs deep within in one’s being. Fishman’s vivid geometric reliefs may not take on the overt physical appearance of pills, but are representative of how pharmaceutical companies utilize aesthetic appeal in their products to offer the promise of a better reality. Each optically alluring and carefully crafted shape stacked within her compositions is assigned an ailment denoted by the title of the work.

 The inviting, and deeply intriguing wall reliefs on view at Miles McEnery Gallery are a continuation of a series Fishman began in 2012, using urethane paint on cut wood panels. With their often large size and bright color palette, the works are confrontational and bursting with tensions that beguile the viewer’s senses. By painting the edges of the pieces with gleaming fluorescent tones, the colors interact with the white of the wall behind it and give the illusion of a neon glow. In some of her compositions, the push and pull between flat and glossy finishes toys with the viewer’s perception of space and reality. The flawless, pristine surfaces of Fishman’s work additionally mimic the clean and technologically precise expanses of research labs and operating tables, directly associated with pharmaceuticals.

 Fishman’s art is able to induce responses that invite the viewer to contemplate not only the ways in which pharmaceutical companies use aesthetics to market their products, but also how they can produce varying versions of reality. As Fishman wrote in an essay for Cultural Politics, our contemporary world is one in which “drugs construct and contest our identities and in which the production and consumption of art can seem like an addiction.”

 BEVERLY FISHMAN (b. 1955, Philadelphia, PA) received her Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1977 from Philadelphia College of Art, and her Master of Fine Arts degree in 1980 from Yale University.

MILES MCENERY GALLERY presents an exhibition of recent paintings by Annie Lapin.

 Annie Lapin’s newest body of work, titled “The Art of Heads and Hands,” builds upon her recent show, “Watchers and Winks, “held at Honor Fraser Gallery in Los Angeles. In this new series, however, Lapin delves further into questions about accident, history and intention in its relationship to meaning. Between spontaneity, chance and deliberation, her surreal pictures emerge with an unnerving clarity that belies the tumult of their creation.

 Lapin begins each piece by pouring a mixture of charcoal and water over roller marks of yellow paint –a completely unpredictable process. These marks become shadows on the linen that Lapin interprets over a series of months. Following a process of free association, she devises painterly tricks to obfuscate the accidents that occur at each stage, giving those marks apparent purpose and significance. Trompe l’oeil, Adobe Photoshop effects, images from her iPhone, and quotations from her own work and others are applied in stages, each resulting in more accidents which must be reckoned with. Her concise techniques a single layer of application despite the illusion of overlay– contradict the circuitous paths toward the end result of each painting. After several rounds of intuitive choice making, a narrative begins to emerge not only through the appearance of figures but also through the forces of space, historical note, and color.

 According to Lapin, “Each painting is an endpoint of a path through time, choices and interpretations. Totally random but masquerading as destiny.” In this body of work, Lapin sees her attempts to sew accidents seamlessly into the pictorial spaces as a metaphor for the patterns our minds devise to organize the morass of daily chaotic inputs. In the same way that our contemporary myths arise from chance events and subjective socio-historical interpretations of those events, these works arrive at a cohesion and become imbued with meaning despite their history of accumulated accident. For Lapin, historical endpoints themselves have always seemed accidental. This is mirrored in her work; art historical allusions appear next to the spontaneous swirls of pours and roller marks, equal players in the story she reveals through each painting.

 ANNIE LAPIN (b. 1978 in Washington, D.C.) received her Bachelors of Arts degree from Yale University in 2001, a Post- Baccalaureate Certificate from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2004, and her Master of Fine Arts from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2007.

Drawing upon the symbiotic relationship between fashion, art, design, and architecture, Contextualizing Fashion celebrates the diverse faculty body at Pratt Institute who, as artists and scholars, employ fashion as a prime motivator in their work. The resulting environment showcases a broad yet compelling narrative where body and dress are examined through alternate modalities, such as performance, garment, spectacle, and body adornment. Contextualizing Fashion challenges established perspectives and explores new narratives within the genre.

AHL Foundation presents the 15th Anniversary Exhibition “Postmodernism and Aesthetics: Collide or Steer?”. This exhibition will feature recent artworks of 22 past awardees of AHL Foundation’s Contemporary Visual Art Awards.

 The artists in this group exhibition spent their youth in the 1990s as immigrant artists or study abroad fine art students in the US. While postmodernism gained a momentum in post-1988 Seoul Olympic Games in South Korea during an economic boom in the 1990s, a milieu o fine arts departments at major universities as well as art markets in Seoul still maintained purity of high modernism of abstract painting.

 Organized by curator and professor Kyunghee Pyun at Fashion Institute of Technology, this exhibition overviews the current statues of about 20 major artists from Korea living and working in the US. As transnational or immigrant artists, they adapted their artistic vocabulary to the demand of the New York art market, global art biennials, local art communities, or glossy art fairs around the world. The show divided artists and their works into the most popular binary themes of Postmodernism and High Modernism such as appropriation/originality; local/international; simulacra/real; personal/universal; and banal/avant-garde. Although applicable to subjective interpretations, each artist’s work can be seen in one of these categories, each with four or five artists.

 In 1977 when most of these artists were young children, the New Museum of Contemporary Art was just founded in SoHo where Mary Boone also opened her eponymous gallery. The civil rights movements and student demonstrations in the 60s brought forth more chaotic society exposing all of its social ills. Facing the fiscal crisis in New York City, intellectuals and artists were more agitated by precarious urban environments and found solace in art communities in SoHo. As Hal Foster and Rosalind Krauss increased followers and readers in the 1980s along with French writers of semiotics and psychoanalysis, art galleries in SoHo gradually invited conceptual and installation artists. Norman Bryson and Terry Eagleton were also among serious readings in Greenwich Village. It was in the late 1980s that Gagosian Gallery and the Kitchen—not-for-profit art center for performance and video art—started a venue in Chelsea, an emerging depot of warehouses-turned-galleries on the west side of New York City.

 South Korea where the participating artists in this exhibition grew up in the 80s discovered literature of postmodernism in the 90s after the 1986 opening of the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Gwacheon, the 1987 June Democracy Movement, and the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games. It was in 1994 when Michel Foucault’s Discipline and Punish was published in the Korean translation and the Minjung Misool (People’s Art) Movement saw a large-scale exhibition celebrating its 15th year anniversary at the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art. Most artists in this exhibition spent their 20s and 30s in the 1990s studying socialist literature and reading postmodernist art criticism in graduate seminars and in underground book clubs. Chaotic and disorderly society was felt more bewildered and confounded in glossy art magazines from New York and London. Unofficial reading activities and art scenes were too distant from studio classes on campus. That is why these artists also pursued prolonged study abroad experience or sometimes became diasporic artists in the United States.

 Few artists in this exhibition major in painting or sculpture. Most artists specialize in performance, conceptual, installation, mixed-media art. Many are versatile media artists encompassing video installations and audience-participating interactive technology. The exhibition catalog will include five essays by Kyunghee Pyun, Mary A. Valverde, Dana Liljegren, Laura Hillegas, and Jinkyoung Choi along with the timeline of postmodernist literature and exhibitions in the US and in South Korea.

The National Exemplar presents Tristano Di Robilant’s “Tarquinia”

 Tarquinia is a town, originally founded by the Etruscans, that lies northwest of Rome on the Aurelian Way.

 Birthplace to Vincenzo Cardarelli, pseudonym of Nazareno Cardarelli (1 May 1887 - 18 June 1959) an Italian poet, essayist and journalist. He created, in 1919 with Riccardo Baccheli and Emilio Cecchi among others, the prestigious magazine La Ronda (1919-1923).
 He won two literary awards, including the 1929 Premio Bagutta for Il Sole a Picco and in 1948 Premio Strega for Villa Tarantola.

 A central figure in Italy’s literary world in the earlier part of the 20th century, he died in poverty in Rome in 1959. Cardarelli reacted to the prevalent decadent and symbolist mood of the period by calling for a return to a form, or in his words, a metaphor of classicism. His work, imbued by an intense melancholia arches over a vast temporal framework, always touchingly disenchanted.

 Di Robilant’s clay tablets pay homage to fragments of Cardarelli’s poems, that ghostlike reappear in all their vibrancy. After his death Cardarelli’s name slipped into relative obscurity. His presence and legacy now largely forgotten.


 Tristano di Robilant was born in London in 1964. He lives and works in Ripabianca, Umbria

P.P.O.W presents Patriots, the gallery’s first exhibition with multimedia artist Hew Locke. The exhibition will continue Locke’s investigation into the role public statues play in the way national identity and history are formed, an element of his practice that he has been exploring since 2002. This interest was initially born out of seeing a statue of Queen Victoria taken down during his childhood in Georgetown, Guyana – an event that toppled his notion that the status quo was in fact static. Later, while living in London, Locke became fascinated with the Victorian statues that dotted the city, emblematic sculptures that were so visible that they had essentially become invisible to passersby. Embarking on a project that he dubbed the “Impossible Proposals,” Locke began photographing these iconic statues – from Richard the Lion Hearted, to the slave trader Edward Colston, to Edward VII – and then embellishing the photographs with objects, creating elaborate fetish figures imbued with a history that was largely being overlooked.

 The exhibition at P.P.O.W will take as its starting point a series of contentious sculptures in the US, including of Peter Stuyvesant, George Washington, JMarion Sims, Alexander Hamilton, and Christopher Columbus, among others, several of which have been the subject of debate for removal over the past several years. Inspired by a tradition in Brussels in which different groups have the opportunity to dress up an iconic cupid figure in different costumes to represent their ethnicity or particular interest, Locke here envisions the opportunity for various ethnic groups to express their relationship to these figures through an elaborate and beautiful costuming ritual. After creating large-scale photographs of these statutes Locke richly decorates them, creating Baroque-like depictions of these figures.

 Among the works on view will be a statute of George Washington decorated with Indian replica war medals, Pre-Colombian cut-outs, silver dollars, an illustration of a slave being tortured by William Blake, and a giant Manilla coin – a slave trading coin – dangling from his forearm. The work explores the relationship between finance and power, and the way in which Washington’s history has been revised to largely exclude the fact that he owned nearly 300 slaves. The portrait will illustrate the long and ongoing timeline of cause and effect and the arc of history that has followed since his presidency. J. Marion Sims – the only photograph on view of a statue that has been removed – will be covered with an image based on one of the women he experimented on, as well as a traditional African Luba carving, depicting a woman holding her breasts – a carving that references a woman holding secrets. He will be covered in small hessian sacks that have Cowrie shells and cheap badges of the Hippocratic sign attached, with a laurel crown on his head. The resulting work envisions him as a nearly heroic figure, an homage to the way he was portrayed historically. Together the works explore the complexity of opinion and perspective surrounding these historical figures and New York landmarks, overturning the notion that the debates surrounding the statues and the figures’ roles in history have been settled, and illustrating the lasting effects of these “patriots’” actions hundreds of years later.

 Also included will be “Song of the South,” a series of drawings created on real confederate shares that reference black minstrel history. The works recall Locke’s many trips to Georgia as a child to visit his father encountering objects in antique shops that reflected the South’s dark history. The works on view not only explore these ideas of Patriotism and Americanism through what Locke describes as his Guyanese point of view, but reflect his many encounters in the US over the past several decades. The exhibition also continues Locke’s interest in exploring the lasting impact of Colonialism, and will include a 9-foot-long refugee boat, embellished and installed in the backroom of the gallery. The installation, which addresses the desperation of people trying to cross the ocean to safety, will be installed against a backdrop of wallpaper made up of confederate shares and maps of Africa and South America. The work is in conversation with the photographs of the statues on view, as Locke imagines these new immigrants walking around and encountering these statues, trying to assess what these people and this history means to them.

 Hew Locke was born in Edinburgh, UK in 1959, and moved to Georgetown, Guyana as a young child. Locke eventually returned to the UK in the 90s to complete his MA in Sculpture at the Royal College of Art. Locke currently lives and works in London. Work by Locke has been exhibited extensively throughout the US and Europe, including in The Folkestone Triennial (2011), the 54th and 55th Venice Biennale (2011, 2013), Deptford X (2012, participating artist curator), Prospect New Orleans Contemporary Art Biennial, New Orleans, LA (2014) and Hangzhou Triennial of Fiber Art (2016). Selected shows include National Portrait Gallery, London, UK; Imperial War Museum, London, UK; El Museo de Bario, New York, NY; Fondation Clément, LeFrancois, Martinique; Bell House, Prague, Czech Republic; Kunsthal KAdE, Amersfoort, Netherlands; Tate Britain, London, UK; Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London, UK; New Art Gallery, Walsall, UK; Rivington Place, London, UK; Bluecoat Gallery. Liverpool, UK; British Museum, London, UK; New Art Exchange, Nottingham, UK; Museum of Art and Design, New York, NY; Atlanta Contemporary Arts, Atlanta, GA; Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn, NY; and Perez Art Museum, Miami, FL. Locke’s multidisciplinary work is in permanent collections, including the United Kingdom’s Government Art Collection; Miami Art Museum, Miami, FL; Tate Gallery,London, UK; Arts Council of England; Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn, NY; Perez Art Museum, Miami, FL; Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art, Kansas City, MO; Kansas City Collection, Kansas City, MO; RISD Museum Providence, RI; New Art Gallery, Walsall, UK; Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London, UK; British Museum, London, UK; and the Henry Moore Institute, Leeds, UK, among others.

Anna Zorina Gallery presents Didier William in Curtains, Stages, and Shadows, a dual exhibition presented in conjunction with James Fuentes.

 Exhibition essay written by Jerry Philogene, Ph. D., Associate Professor in the American Studies Department at Dickinson College, Pennsylvania.

 Didier William’s most recent body of work, Curtains, Stages, and Shadows — as well as the title of this exhibition — explores the relationship between the formal tensions and the narrative capacities of painting. A series of large-scale mixed-media paintings replete with bold decorative patterns and cut through eye-shaped forms insist on a beauty and a sensuality that is almost audible and in the realm of the haptic. The titles of the pieces appear in Haitian Kreyòl, unapologetically, with no English translations or subtitles. Inspired by memories of growing up in a resilient yet vulnerable Haitian community in Miami and coming of age when black and brown immigrant bodies have come to symbolize precarious living, William created these mixed-media pieces as pictorial rather than narrative. As with most of his works, the body takes center stage, literally and figuratively. For William, the recurring motif of the stage evokes the unsettled sensation of immigrant life in the diaspora. There is always a performance to be “Black”, a performance to be “West Indian” or “Caribbean,” and a performance to pale angle kòrèkteman. Consequently, for Kreyòl-speaking immigrant people, Blackness, Caribbeanness, and language competence are cultural markers that are in constant negotiation to determine belonging. The paintings highlight a deep sense of vulnerability, yet their aestheticization is marked by a desire for deeper and more complex thinking of how to transcend such vulnerability and become inherently provocative.

 There is a tension in the works: a certain yearning to go against the constructs of the limiting everyday coupled with a hopefulness that longs for a different possible future. In Nou Tout Ansanm, the urban eccentric landscape of the global Caribbean city that is Miami coalesces within the familiar conventionality of painting. The black and blue curtains that descend over the suspended bodies are reminiscent, for William, of the blue plastic tarps that covered the booths of Ti Mache, an outdoor flea market held in Opa-locka, Miami Dade County. The booths were operated by Haitian men and women who sold sundries and food goods that they had procured from Haiti. Ti Mache, William remembers, was a space that was “packed with Haitians at their most Haitian. Nobody was trying to acquiesce to anything or change their behavior…a place where everyone spoke Kreyòl.”1 While this sense of community and of a shared identity is suggested in the title of the piece, the groundlessness of the bodies reminds the viewer of the destabilizing and precarious nature of immigrant living. An intentionally imprecisely drawn shadow of the figures graces the stage floor, hinting to the presence of unrecognizable bodies teetering between an untethered space where light is obstructed by an opaque object. Images of machetes grouped together form a decorative configuration in the background, perhaps alluding to a vanishing tradition of tire machèt, a martial art still practiced in parts of Haiti. Drawing on personal memories, William visually articulates the complex social dynamics of contemporary immigrant urban living.

 Ou ap tonbe, men m ap kenbe ou displays a curtain fashioned in abstract shapes with vibrant reds, oranges, yellows, greens, and blues. A standing figure balances preciously on the edge of the stage; a kneeling figure braces the figure with a hand. Our eyes are forced to look at bodies at odd angles that bend, float, and stand straight while swirling carved lines form borders around these vibrating bodies. Through compositions like these, William creates a metaphoric language out of images. There is a deliberate intention to fashion the body into a language, so that its corporeality speaks a language that references both medical anatomy and art history. While there is no clear narrative visible in the works, we have instead beautiful allegories pregnant with memories long forgotten and stories never spoken. Look closely at the kaleidoscope-patterned curtains and at the shadows on the stage and you will see their refusal to be hidden, to proclaim their existence and offer an aesthetic refusal and resistance to silence and absence.

 These compelling works reconfigure the dynamics of the gaze. The cut-through eye-shaped muscular figures embody the authoritative tensions among looking at, being looked at, and looking back, intrepidly shifting the subject/object power dynamic. They encourage an active seeing experience, one that reveals the struggles that are tirelessly fought by those who live courageously at the margins and who constantly attempt to obliterate those boundaries. Moreover, the looking at/back experience is not simply occurring on the part of the viewer. Explicitly, by their presence, these eye-shaped bodies bestow upon the viewer a cross between a defiant look and a dismissive seeing, one that Haitians refer to as kout je: a sharp side-eye that at its boldest and most direct evokes the presence of bodies that were denied the right to look back.

 These paintings draw our attention to the provocative interstices made by the encounters among distinctive shapes, lines, forms, and colors. Thus, the method of looking is different. It needs to be decidedly haptic. It needs to be deliberately engaging. It needs to be mindful of the resonances created at the points of encounter between the composition of painting, the materiality of printmaking, and the precision of drawing. It is in this context that we can understand William’s work. The paintings capture the essence of power, sensuality, and presence while not shying away from the challenges hidden in the shadows.

 These non-gendered, non-racialized bodies strikingly document an almost intuitive sense of resilience and profundity, visualizing universal elements of the human condition that are without regard for race, sexuality orientation, or gender identity. We may be mesmerized by the beauty of their sensuous shape, but we are also transfixed by their shadows as they appear on the vividly-colored and patterned curtains, share the stage, and dwell on the ornate, painterly abstract backgrounds. Sinewy lines, seemingly frenetic curvilinear marks, guide our eyes to the ways in which William balances suggestive abstract sensibilities with expressive organic qualities. It is in this context that William’s recent work captivates us, through the haptic that suggests movement, color, form, and, most importantly, a harmonious sensuality. His mixed-media works possess a compositional logic that examines how painting and printmaking energetically coalesce on the surfaces of the panels. In these decidedly detailed-oriented works, William explores the role of painting and printmaking as processes that intertwine the hand with the mechanical. We can almost feel the reverence for the materiality generated by vivid areas of color and a meticulousness of line. This cross-disciplinary expertise allows the viewer to relish in his deft control and skill in emotive mark making. The works gathered in this exhibition provide further demonstration of the wonder and ingenuity of William’s unique visual harmony and compositional dynamism.

Steven Kasher Gallery presents Throw Shade, Then Vote a solo exhibition of work by Pete Souza, former Chief Official White House Photographer. The exhibition features 13 photographs with texts that are portraits in Presidential contrasts. They tell a tale of the Obama and Trump administrations through a series of visual/textual juxtapositions. Souza’s unforgettable images of President Obama hold new power and meaning when framed by the tweets, news headlines, and quotes that defined the first 500 days of the Trump White House. These works are based on Souza’s renowned Instagram feed, and are being exhibited to launch the publication of Shade: A Tale of Two Presidents (Little Brown, October 16th). With this timely and important body of work, Shade demonstrates the power of photography to galvanize our emotions and encourage us to act.

 As Chief Official White House Photographer, Pete Souza spent more time alongside President Barack Obama than almost anyone else. His years photographing the President gave him an intimate behind-the-scenes view of the unique gravity of the Office of the Presidency—and the tremendous responsibility that comes with it. Souza’s photographs are a rejoinder to the chaos, abuses of power, and destructive policies that now define our nation’s highest office. They are a reminder of a man and a President we could believe in, a courageous defender of the highest American values.

 When Pete Souza left the White House in 2017, he didn’t know what it meant to “throw shade”—but he started doing it almost immediately on his personal Instagram account, posting his photographs from the Obama years with captions that vividly define the contrast between the Obama White House and President Trump’s administration. Media organizations took notice of Souza’s posts. New York magazine called them “a master class in shade,” CNN described them as “a silent, social media, shade-throwing protest told in visuals,” and Politico named Souza “King of Instagram Shade.” Souza calls it telling the truth. His following on Instagram is now close to two million people.

 Pete Souza has had solo exhibition of his photographs at the Leica Gallery in NYC, Kansas State University, Fermilab, the U.S. Naval Academy, the Navy Museum, The Kennedys Museum in Berlin, the University of North Carolina, Boston University, Ohio University and the National Press Club in Washington. His photographs have been included group exhibits at the National Archives, Smithsonian Museum of American History and Corcoran Gallery of Art.

 Souza was the Chief Official White House Photographer for President Obama and the Director of the White House Photo Office from 2009-2017. Previously Souza was a national photographer for the Chicago Tribune from 1998-2007, a freelancer for National Geographic and Life, and the Official White House Photographer for President Reagan from 1983-1989. His books include the New York Times bestseller The Rise of Barack Obama, which documents the president’s meteoric ascent from his first day in the United States Senate through the 2008 Pennsylvania presidential primary, and the #1 New York Times bestseller Obama: An Intimate Portrait. Souza is currently a based in Washington, DC, and is a Professor Emeritus at Ohio University’s School of Visual Communication.

Garvey|Simon presents Melissa Stern: Strange Girls, an exhibition featuring the artist’s evocative and dark-witted works. Stern works across all media to include assemblage, ceramics, painting, drawings and collage. This is Stern’s first solo show with Garvey|Simon, and her ninth solo show in New York. The opening reception will take place on Thursday, October 11, 6-8pm. The artist will be present. The show is accompanied by a color catalog with essay by Meg Shiffler, Director and Chief Curator, San Francisco Arts Commission Galleries.

 In Strange Girls, Melissa Stern explores the definition of girlhood as a state of being and state of mind. Stern’s sisterhood ranges from lusty pin-up girls to minimalist, geometric bodies, embracing all within the loving arms of femininity and oddity. Though all share an innate formal elegance, each is afflicted by a sense of imbalance and loss: figures stride proudly as they are bisected by their frames, and voluptuous, fishnet-clad legs are severed from their bodies. In Stern’s fantasyland, girlhood is juxtaposition: beauty afflicted by the melancholy of insufficiency. The work hits an emotional soft spot in all of us, echoing our desire to belong to the norm. “We are all strange girls,” says Stern, “We all harbor some memory of feeling like an outsider, a stranger.”

 Melissa Stern sources her images and allusions from magazines, knick-knacks, and other cultural detritus. She acts as both gatherer and creator, excavating and collecting vintage artifacts, and orchestrating these into open-ended narratives. The work is a mélange of random life moments and sardonic references, what the artist calls, “the flotsam of memory and the jetsam of popular culture.” Her universe is at once familiar and alien. Doll parts, crudely shaped ceramic heads, and magazine advertisements combine to poke and stir-up the collective subconscious. Stern’s girls recall intimate moments and prompt the viewer to converse and grapple with them. Though she baits and teases us with the apparent levity of her sculptures, these Strange Girls possess a grit and seriousness beneath their playful humor and wit.

 A collaboration between intention and chance, Stern allows her objects to organically claim their identity in process. The sculpture, Stiff, embodies Stern’s condition of girlhood and her play with materiality. Standing innocent and self-conscious in her pink underwear, midriff peeking out from the hem of her top, the pointy-eared lass is acutely aware of her own discomfort. Her t-shirt, which Stern molded carefully from beeswax, is at once a source of discomfort and protection, a suit of armor that, when challenged, melts away. Perhaps a reference to our nightmares of being caught in the cafeteria in just our knickers—or something even more sinister—we are reminded that our insecurities are communal.

 “My sometimes goofy figures live in a dream world, cower in relationships or stand tall in the face of adversity. Some people think they’re funny which is always interesting and never wrong.”

 Born in 1958, Melissa Stern grew up in Philadelphia. She received a BA in 1980 from Wesleyan University in both Anthropology and Studio Art, and an MFA in Ceramics from SUNY New Paltz in 1984.

Sundaram Tagore Chelsea presents a specially curated selection of rarely seen landscapes by celebrated photographer Sebastião Salgado. This stunning collection of prints comprises work from his noted Genesis series, as well as an image from his newest project in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest, which is intended to raise awareness of threats to the region from logging, mining, dam building, cattle and soybean farming and climate change. This is an opportunity to preview work from his next photographic project.

 From the ancient basalt columns of Mitsio Island, Madagascar, to sun showers over the Kamchatka Central Valley in Russia, these landscapes pay homage to nature in its original state. Salgado skillfully captures vast and remote realities where nature endures as it existed thousands of years ago. With deeply compelling narratives, these works may be photojournalistic in nature, but technically and compositionally, they stand on their own as masterful works of art. A selection of images will also be on view at Sundaram Tagore Madison Avenue at 83rd Street.

 Sebastião Salgado has made it his life’s work to document the impact of globalization on humankind. In the past three decades, he has traveled to more than 100 countries for his photographic projects and devotes years to each series in order to grasp the full scope of his topic. Genesis is Salgado’s third long-term series on global issues, following Workers (1986–1992) and Exodus (1993–1999). Eight years in the making, Salgado calls Genesis his “love letter to the planet.” Currently, he is shooting in the Amazon where he is focusing on indigenous people and their vanishing environment and way of life.

 Sebastião Salgado was born in 1944 in Brazil. He lives in Paris, France. Having studied economics, Salgado began his career as a professional photographer in 1973 in Paris. He worked with various agencies including Magnum Photos until 1994, when he and Lélia Wanick Salgado formed Amazonas Images, created exclusively for his work.

 Salgado’s work has been the subject of numerous books including Other Americas (1986), Sahel: l’homme en détresse (1986), Sahel: el fin del camino (1988), Workers (1993), Terra (1997), Migrations and Portraits (2000), Africa (2007), Genesis (2013), The Scent of a Dream (2015) and Kuwait, A Desert on Fire (2016). Touring exhibitions of this work have been and continue to be presented throughout the world. In 2013, the book De ma terre à la Terre (From my land to the planet), a narrative account of his life and career was published, and in 2014, the documentary film The Salt of the Earth, directed by Wim Wenders and Juliano Ribeiro Salgado, was released.

 Sebastião Salgado has been awarded numerous major photographic prizes. He is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, and among other distinctions, an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In April 2016, Salgado was elected member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts of the Institut de France, for the seat previously occupied by Lucien Clergue. In July 2016, he was named Chevalier de la Légion d’Honneur, France. Lélia Wanick Salgado and Sebastião Salgado have worked since the 1990s on the restoration of a portion of the Atlantic Forest in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil. In 1998 they succeeded in turning this land into a nature reserve and created the Instituto Terra, dedicated to reforestation, conservation and environmental education.

Widely known as a gifted musician, vocalist, and producer whose awards include the National Medal of Arts and 9 Grammys, few are aware that Herb Alpert is also an accomplished artist.

 Herb Alpert: A Visual Melody will present over a dozen of his abstract paintings along with a few of his small-scale bronze sculptures.

 Much like his music, Alpert’s paintings and sculptures are free-flowing compositions encompassing a complex range of forms, heightened by lyrical curves and unexpected twists.

 “New York has always been an inspirational city to me for both my music and my art,” said Herb Alpert. “I am excited to continue to work with Heather James Fine Art to bring my sculptures and paintings to this vibrant city.”

 Herb Alpert and Lani Hall in Concert: October 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13
 Performances will take place at New York’s Café Carlyle. For more info, please visit: http://www.herbalpert.com

 Herb Alpert (b.1935) has created Abstract Expressionist paintings and sculpture for over two decades. His work has been exhibited in museums, galleries, and art fairs throughout the U.S. and Europe including the Pasadena Museum of California Art, Art Cologne, and Art Basel, as well as part of the permanent collections of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; the Tennessee State Museum, Nashville; and The Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago. New York public art installations have included Dante Park (2013) and Bryant Park (2005).

 In addition to being a multi-disciplinary artist, Herb and Lani Hall Alpert are noted philanthropists. Established in 1994, the Herb Alpert Awards in the Arts annually honor risk-taking artists working in the fields of dance, film and video, music, theater, and the visual arts.

The Directors of Marlborough Gallery present paintings by the world-renowned artist Fernando Botero. These new works revisit the major subjects he has depicted over the course of his career.

 The familiar figures in paintings by Botero are as voluptuous as they are charismatic. Whether he is depicting female nudes, bullfighters, dance hall denizens, clowns, revelers, lovers, Grandes Dames, musicians, families or a bowl of fruit, Botero’s skill and style make the work unmistakably his own. As writer David Ebony puts it, “Art audiences, critics, and collectors see the famously rotund figures that populate his compositions as emblematic archetypes: sensuous icons of plenty, of good health and good fortune.”

 For the artist, form and color work together to illuminate the
 heightened reality of each painted figure or scene. In Botero’s
 paintings no element is gratuitous – “everything is necessary” as
 he explains. Although a figurative painter, he achieves a balance
 in composition and color that shows his understanding and
 assimilation of the essential tenets of abstraction. Light, created by
 his synthesis of colors, is especially important. Botero never paints
 heavy shadows as he considers them the enemy of color. He has
 stated, “I would say that in my painting there is an interior light that is like morning light. What most resembles this internal, color-like “light” is the light of the morning hours…everything is clearer and more uniform.”

 Fernando Botero was born in Medellín, Colombia in 1932. Since his first solo gallery show in 1951, the artist has been exhibited in museums all over the world. He began showing with Marlborough Gallery in 1972. Over the past forty years he has held numerous museum exhibitions in the following countries: Argentina, Belgium, Canada, China, Colombia, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Portugal, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Venezuela, and the United States.

 Botero’s work can be found in over fifty museums worldwide. They include: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.; Museo de Arte Contemporaneo de Caracas, Venezuela; Museo de Arte Moderno, Bogota, Colombia; Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Santiago, Chile; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Neue Pinakothek, Munich, Germany; Pushkin Museum, Moscow, Russia; The Baltimore Museum of Art, Maryland; the Israel Museum, Jerusalem; The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Wallraf-Richartz Museum, Cologne, Germany; and The State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia.

<![CDATA[
Berry Campbell Gallery presents a special exhibition of recent paintings by Susan Vecsey. This is Berry Campbell Gallery’s third exhibition of Susan Vecsey’s work since announcing the artist’s representation in 2014. Vecsey is widely held in both public and private collections including the Greenville County Museum of Art, South Carolina and Guild Hall Museum, East Hampton.

 As written in the exhibition essay by Phyllis Tuchman, susan Vecsey’s latest abstractions call to mind both Color Field paintings as well as landscapes. They exist somewhere in the middle, neither one nor the other. For starters, instead of working with acrylic pigments and yards of unstretched canvas as a Color Field artist might do, Vecsey executes her evocative pictures the old-fashioned way. To linen surfaces, she applies layers of oil pigments. Depending on the weather, it can take days for each plane of color she has thinned with turpentine to dry. Occasionally, she makes larger works in a diptych format. As it is, to get started, she relies on a few academic basics. She makes small charcoal drawings on the spot; and after that, pastels and color studies before she ever picks up any brushes, sponges, rags, or pour buckets. Then, she improvises. She once said that you need to be “ready to accept or reject the unexpected.”

 Living on the East End of Long Island, Vecsey has a lot to inspire her. She is, after all, ensconced in a wide range of landscapes, including deep, dense backwoods, picturesque beaches, farmlands and vineyards, big skies, sunny days, dramatic sunsets, raging snowstorms, and trees cloaked in autumnal tonalities. In the past few years, however, she has stripped these images of their specificity. Vecsey freely admits, “I’m not making up shapes.” However, she is simplifying them in order to portray something universal. It’s her goal to work with “images that everyone can understand.”

 Making abstract art that looks familiar is one of Vecsey’s singular gifts. In front of one of her works, you might suspect that you are watching waves lapping against the shore while, in another, two roads may seem to be converging. But you never can be sure of this. Her imagery is elusive. That’s part of the power of her paintings.

 Vecsey is well aware that, as she puts it, she operates in a place where both “freedom and restraint” go hand in hand. Recently, she explained that she starts with a blank canvas and the notion that, as a painter, she can do whatever she wants. But, with landscape as a given, she faces a decided restraint. When she executed more straightforward landscapes, her titles identified beaches, waves, and harbors as well as nocturnes. Today, her pictures project calm and serenity.

 Unlike, say, Fairfield Porter, another East End artist, Vecsey is less involved with the here and now. She’s not recording the details of daily life. She’s reminding you of places where you have been. With swooping curves, extended horizon lines, and a mix of tonal colors, Vecsey’s compelling images have the character of memories, recollections, reveries. You’re revisiting sites of pleasure and wonderment.

 Susan Vecsey was born in New Jersey and currently lives and works in both New York City and East Hampton, New York. She earned her Bachelor of Arts from Barnard College, Columbia University, New York, and her Master of Fine Arts from the New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture, studying under Graham Nickson. In 2012, Vecsey was a visiting artist at the American Academy in Rome. In 2017, Susan Vecsey had a solo museum exhibition at the Greenville County Museum in South Carolina, featuring numerous large-scale paintings. That same year, the John Jermain Memorial Library, Sag Harbor, New York, presented another solo exhibition of Vecsey’s paintings and works on paper. In reference to Vecsey’s 2014 show at Berry Campbell Gallery, New York, Franklin Einspruch declared in Artcritical, “this is virtuoso painting.” Vecsey’s work was featured in Guild Hall Museum’s 2014 Selections from the Permanent Collection curated by Museum Director/Chief Curator, Christina Strassfield, alongside Eric Fischl, April Gornik, Balcomb Greene, Mary Heilmann, and David Salle. She has collaborated with numerous architects and designers, including Mabley Handler Design, Water Mill, New York, and Daniel Kahan, Smith and Moore Architects, Palm Beach, Florida. In recent years, the distinguished design dealers, Lee Jofa and Brunschwig &amp; Fils, have used several of her paintings in advertising campaigns. Vecsey has been featured in magazines such as Architectural Digest, Hamptons Magazine, and Veranda. Susan Vecsey’s paintings are widely held in public and private collections around the world. Vecsey is represented by Berry Campbell Gallery in New York.

Derek Eller Gallery presents White Lies, an exhibition of new paintings by Despina Stokou.

 The immediacy of information in the digital era is central to Stokou’s work. With dense layers of text and visceral marks, she accurately captures the cacophony of our current political and social climate. In these paintings and throughout her practice, language is sourced from various public (primarily online) platforms. Excerpts from Twitter posts, interviews, and political commentary are quoted and presented in dizzying chromatic gestures, varying in degrees of legibility and coherence. With this new body of paintings, Stokou also employs a blocking technique, wherein broad white strokes further erase or silence the points of view represented within.

 Central to the exhibition is #AmericaIn3Words, a large painting stretched seamlessly over three panels. Stokou describes the process of making this painting as almost trancelike, stating “This was not a planned work, I blinked and it was in the studio.” A hashtag that shares the same name asked participants to describe the United States with three words. This hashtag began trending around July 4, 2018 after news of the family separation policy at the southern border began to permeate the public conscience. The exercise elicited a variety of responses on Twitter which Stokou has collected on these canvases. “America Still Racist,” “Children in Cages,” “Can’t Afford Gas” and “Guns over Government” are each individual responses which born of far flung ethos, collectively capture the political rage of this specific moment in history.

 Here and throughout her work, Stokou does not shy away from challenging subjects, but chooses instead to confront them with an energetic physicality. White supremacy, systemic sexism, cultural violence and the complacency of art world participants are also addressed in the work of this exhibition. Presenting these topics as boldly painted canvases rife with text which struggles to be intelligible, Stokou highlights the notion that society’s online debates may be loud and brash, while the voices of the disenfranchised remain unheard, effectively hidden in plain sight.

 White Lies will be Stokou’s fourth solo exhibition at Derek Eller Gallery. In 2018, she mounted solo exhibitions at Praz-Delavallade, Los Angeles and Dio Horia Gallery, Mykonos, Greece. Her work has been featured in exhibitions at Kunsteverein Gera, Gera; Five Car Garage, Los Angeles; The KW Art Institute, Berlin; The Pit, Los Angeles; Gagosian Gallery, Athens; Ibid, Los Angeles; Nathalie Karg Gallery, New York; Eigen + Art, Berlin; and Krinzinger Projekte, Vienna.

Morgan Lehman Gallery presents A Sax in the Attic, a collaborative exhibition between artists Jonathan Ryan Storm and Louis Reith. After presenting their two-person show Hypnotic Country Yoga at the Amsterdam-based Mini Galerie earlier this year, A Sax in the Attic marks the first time these two have teamed up in the United States. The title of this show, perhaps a non-sequitur at first blush, brings to
 mind ideas that might inform a viewer’s reading of the works: the structured chaos of
 complicated jazz patterns, a search for hidden treasures, the dust of forgotten times.

 Jonathan Ryan Storm’s recent paintings delight in the hypnotic, even psychedelic visual possibilities of color and line, while asserting a charmingly maladroit material presence through the use of stretched/collaged textile elements and chunky oil stick application. The resulting works are playful, hand wrought, and visually rewarding in person. This interest in quality of surface and the sculpturesque extends to Louis Reith’s vocabulary as well: he makes paintings by applying richly dark soil to shaped wood panels and renders works on paper using ink and collage on found book pages. In Reith’s works, there is a sense of elegance and balance that feels inherent not only linearity of the forms depicted but also the materials/supports themselves. While Storm’s process relies heavily on intuitive decision making whereby each step in a painting leads to the next, Reith is more firmly planted in an art-making method of forethought and calculation. Both artists overtly reference an art-history past, whether it’s Modernist design, Post-Painterly abstraction, or assemblage, but the results are more than simply filled with longing. Rather, A Sax in the Attic is the culmination of two painters playing their respective visions
 of abstraction against one another, to optimistic effect.

Denise Bibro Fine Art presents its first solo exhibition of New York artist, Susan Woods, Drawing with Metal.

 Woods’ primary focus throughout her extensive career has been sculpture and functional sculptural art. Recently she has also completed a body of impactful, autobiographical based drawings.Woods’ sculpture and drawings share a common force. Her sculpture, although often rooted in an idea or observation, are still spontaneous and organic. Their beginnings do not necessarily dictate their endings. Her works, however spontaneous, are carefully crafted. Her metal works are three-dimensional drawings on the surface, but they are also intricate compositions packed with multi-directions. The juxtaposed geometric and organic forms in these works suggest interesting compositions of space and line. The trajectory of each composition is multifaceted. The interplay of black and white creates depth. They evoke three dimensionalities of form and space.
 Her body of drawings, although often importing the same modus operandi as her sculptures, is more autobiographical. There are references to happenings and natural landscapes. The compositions are more biomorphic, flowing in line and demonstrating rich shading to define the composition and nuance.

 Woods has had numerous exhibitions. Among her solo shows are 479 Gallery in Philadelphia, PA and The Seaport Museum, Salem, MA. She has also exhibited at The W Hotels, Chicago International Art Exposition &amp; The Jayson Gallery, Chicago, IL; The Vera Redmond Gallery, The Woodmere Museum, and The Nexus Foundation for Today’s Art in Philadelphia, PA and The Sculpture Center, NYC. Her works have been acquired by several selected public and private collections including Newark Liberty International Airport, NJ; PLC Arabia, Saudi Arabia; Lincoln Center Film Society Café, New York, NY; H. H. Shekh Suroor Bin Mohammad Al Nahyan, The Etihad Tower-Abu Dhabi, UAE; Aveda-NYC &amp; Washington, D.C.; Ann Taylor-New York, NYC; W-Hotels, Union Square, NYC; Silver Jet Airlines, VIP Lounge-Newark, Airport, NJ; Cartier &amp; Fortuni, NYC; AC Hotel in Minneapolis, MN to name a few. She has been featured in many publications including Interior Design Magazine, The New York Times, Metropolis, NYC, Crain’s, The New York Sun, The New York Daily News, Metropolitan Home, Surface and The Dallas Morning News.

 Woods studied at the Montserrat School of Visual Art, Beverly, MA; The Boston Museum College of Art &amp; Massachusetts College of Art, Boston, MA; The Sculpture Center &amp; National School of Design, NYC and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia, PA.

Denise Bibro Fine Art presents Warren Linn’s second solo exhibition, Almost a Portrait, on view in Gallery II.

 Warren Linn maintains sketchbooks. His daily practice of drawing becomes the basis and source for his artwork. These are chronicles. The artist utilizes his forty years of experience with illustrations to reconstruct his sketches and previous fragments into collages and assemblages of variously shaped forms. Although Linn initially starts with a well-planned intention or narrative, his work is deeply informed by the unexpected. Accident, surprise, and discovery are incorporated into his creative process. Linn is both blessed and burdened with insatiability. He often revisits works for editing after having thought them resolved. Similar to the Abstract Expressionists who inspired him early on, Linn allows the viewer to pick up where he leaves off, resulting in works open to interpretation despite the definitive imagery. The ambiguity within his collages is a product of drawing, painting, and construction coming together.

 Warren Linn is on the faculty of the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA). He has worked as an illustrator for major media clients, and exhibited in a wide range of galleries and venues over the past four decades including the Maryland Institute College of Art, Baltimore, MD; Society of Illustrators, New York, NY; Baltimore Museum of Art, Baltimore, MD; St. John’s University, Jamaica, NY; The Jazz Gallery, New York, NY; Parsons School of Design, New York, NY; Esther Rand Gallery, New York, NY; Mesa Contemporary Arts Center, Mesa, AZ; The Knitting Factory, New York, NY; The Art Directors Club, New York, NY; Artists Guild of Chicago, Chicago, IL; The Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, IL; Aichi Prefectural Museum of Art, Nagoya, Japan.

<![CDATA[
The Hole presents its third solo exhibition by Misaki Kawai “Pine Cone Times.” Two Octobers ago she brought us “Cave Life” painting the entire gallery yellow with black cave paintings and animal furniture CHECK IT OUT and three years before that we got a giant black combable dog sculpture and fluffy pink paintings (and combs!) for “Hair Show” see that one HERE so boy, we are super excited for this year’s October Misaki surprise.

 Apparently this October it is pine cone time! From her home base in Osaka, Japan, Kawai traveled to Vermont where she and her family lived and worked this September to make the show. “Pinecone Pond” which included a big barn and meandering river was the setting for the creation of these paintings. Made with acrylic paint and river water, all artworks were created al fresco and occasionally enjoyed the support of Kawai’s 3-year-old daughter Poko.

 These new paintings are what Misaki calls “sloppy style” or the hasty, brushy improvisational style that she has implemented many times in her career. It captures her inventiveness and sense of humour that is an intrinsic part of “Heta-Uma” or “Good/Bad” style of artmaking that developed in Japan.

 Faces are so wrong they are right, the flower pot is so misshapen that it is perfect, the dog’s face is deformed but evocative. That is the approach of Heta-Uma and here we find both misshapen dogs and cats, girls and boys, flowers and footwear. With a no-comment black background in every piece, the oddities themselves are presented straightforwardly. She isn’t making a scene, or an environment; her work is more deadpan symbolic like that of Donald Baechler or King Terry in Japan.

 It has been fifteen years since her amazing debut solo show in NYC at Clementine Gallery! Kawai has exhibited widely, in recent years mostly at institutions. She has had a solo show at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston (2007); a solo show at one of Japan’s leading private institutions, Watari Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo (2006); she was included in “Greater New York 2″ at PS1 Contemporary art center, New York (2005); “Fun” at Rhiimaki Art Museum Finland (2012); and presented solo museum exhibitions at Malmo Konsthall (2012) and at the Children’s Museum of Art in New York City (2012) .

 Major works in the MOCA Los Angeles and the Watermill Center NY have garnered attention in 2015 and 2016. In 2009 she was included in “Visions of the Frontier” at Institut Valencia d’Art Modern and “I Believe: Japanese Contemporary Art” at the Museum or Modern Art, Toyama. She has recently exhibited with V1 Gallery in Copenhagen and Loyal Gallery in Sweden, as well as Take Ninagawa in Tokyo; a recent exhibition and solo booth at NADA with Eric Firestone garnered a lot of attention as well last year. This year she presented solo exhibitions at Avenuel Art Hall, Seoul and Lotte Gallery in Busan. She lives and works in Osaka when not traveling extensively.

<![CDATA[
The Hole presents its first solo exhibition by Jonathan Chapline of painting and sculpture. A standout in our group show “Post Analog Painting II” last year, Chapline went on to have amazing works with us in art fairs around the world, so it is at long last we are happy to finally present a full exhibition of these fascinating works.

 The digital aesthetics in the paintings had us eagerly add him to “Post Analog Painting II” and the cover of the catalogue. Like Avery Singer and many other young artists Chapline uses 3D programs to sketch out and render artworks in ways previously impossible. The style of the program lends itself to arranging slabs in space and then sorta pulling them out into thickness and volume; the light function allows you to shine digital light across the surfaces you have made to see mathematically how it would bend and reflect.

 If Chapline just made digital prints they would be captivating; however, happily he synthesizes the sketches to carefully paint the image in acrylic and flashe on panel. Flashe is a vinyl-based paint invented in the 50s that has an opaque and velvety matte feel to the surface, like tempera. Each polygon of color is taped off and painted, with a cutting edge, neon underpainting and handmade imperfection he learned from apprenticing with painter Jules de Balincourt. His use of color and more pop sensibility you might see from his years apprenticing for the artist KAWS thereafter.

 The digital sketching and carefully constructed application get you through the how-it-was-made bit; however, the content of the works and their compositional and color choices help us get to the why. All ten new paintings in the show are horizontal; architecturally-interesting domestic interiors, still lifes, bathers. And each feels like an HD panoramic-ratio movie still. Light in the paintings seems to be the protagonist as it wraps around the faceted forms and pools in colorful shadows, while the occasional knife or power drill or broken bottle adds a hint of threat.

 The one sculpture in the show is a curious extract of the paintings: both figures and figurines appear in the paintings, and it is unclear whether this sculpture is a sculpture of a sculpture. It certainly looks to reference Henri Matisse, so perhaps it is a 3D rendering of a 2D collage work from the Post-Impressionist master. The title “Digital Artifact” suggests that this form is based on a 3D program misreading or messing up the translation of the original cutout, and adds a new layer to our interpretation of the exhibition; perhaps it is more in the slippages than the successes in his use of technology that the artist finds inspiration.

Jack Hanley Gallery presents a solo show by Mischa Richter “I Live Here”. The exhibition is based on Richter’s strong memories and attachment to Provincetown and the idiosyncratic characters, buildings and relationship to the water that inhabit this village.

 Richter recreates his environment and its community through photographs, transplanting his surroundings: part of his own studio walls, the photo series “457” (house number of his grandfather). His grandfather was an artist and cartoonist- and the wooden floors of his house create a space that is manifested in the mind rather than geographical coordinates. The installation explores the specificity and intensity of his connection to this town that has changed and morphed dramatically.

 Mischa Richter has shown his work in London and Provincetown and currently lives in Brooklyn, NY. He was born in Windsor, England but spent most of his childhood in Provincetown, Massachusetts. He studied art at The Chelsea College of Art and Design and Middlesex Universtiy both in London, England. After leaving University he began a career in editorial photography and has been published in magazines such as Esquire, Vogue, The New York Times Magazine, Wallpaper and Vibe.

Nicelle Beauchene presents Alice Tippit’s Long Red Moans, the artist’s second solo exhibition at the gallery. Continuing to explore the interpretations of visual language, Tippit’s latest body of work mines the psychology and susceptibility of reading the erotic in the everyday.

 Tippit’s painting style is graphic—pictures, signs, and symbols are rendered with minimal detailing and a restricted palette. Rife with innuendo, sly humor, and myriad readings, the artist uses areas of monochromatic color to create fluid positive and negative space. The slippage between one visual reading to the next is further complicated by Tippit’s use of titles. Rarely explaining the painting’s content, they instead serve as another subsequent entry point.

 Tippit reexamines the ability of objects to eclipse their ordinary or useful associations through a sexualized subtlety that infiltrates her familiar imagery. Flowers bloom, drapes peak open, a claw gapes. Coupled with Tippit’s close crops and unexpected juxtapositions, these objects become catalysts to amplify suggestive readings. There is a constant state of encountering in Tippit’s work—viewing and re-viewing as the erotic takes shape in the mundane, mimicking the push and pull of desire.

 Alice Tippit (b. 1975) graduated from the Art Institute of Chicago and lives and works in Chicago, Illinois. Recent solo and group exhibitions include: Shane Campbell Gallery, Chicago, IL; Kimmerich Gallery, Berlin; Anton Kern Gallery, New York, NY; Peana Projects; Monterrey, MX; 47 Canal, New York, NY; Greene Exhibitions, Los Angeles, CA; IL; Devening Projects, Chicago, IL; Jancar Jones, Los Angeles, CA; and Important Projects, San Francisco, CA.

<![CDATA[
440 Gallery presents “Real People I’ve Never Met,” a solo exhibition of figurative oil paintings by Janet Pedersen. This is Pedersen’s first solo show at the gallery and is a body of work produced during the past year.

 Pedersen’s studio paintings are based on iPhone images that she snaps on New York City streets while keenly observing people on the go. “I have always been interested in figures in movement within the city in motion. As a landscape and figurative painter, there’s no better backdrop. These paintings are about private and intimate moments: the walker deep in thought, a woman touching up her makeup on a moving train, two co-workers on a cigarette break. Here are the urban scenes that we come across every day, and it is all on full display.”

 The creative challenge for Pedersen was how to move beyond traditional representation in order to build dynamic compositions. Using abstracted features and conscientiously redesigning boundaries through color and shape, light and shadow, Pedersen all the while holds on to the simple human gestures that made her stop to stare in the first place. She cites influences as the Bay Area Figurative Movement artists Richard Diebenkorn, David Park and Joan Brown for their approach to painting the figure and ordinary scenes of life.

 A graduate of Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, Pedersen currently lives in Brooklyn NY. Before turning to fine art painting, she enjoyed a successful career as an illustrator of 17 children’s books including four that she authored. Clients included noted publishers Candlewick Press, Clarion, Random House and Penguin Books. Pedersen is an online instructor of figure drawing through the Academy of Art University in San Francisco, and when she is not painting in the studio, she is on her bike with easel and paints in tow, on that never-ending pursuit to chase the light in her Brooklyn neighborhood.

 Janet’s work has been widely exhibited and can be found in collections both domestically and abroad.

agnès b. presents the solo exhibition “PRIZE” by Curtis Kulig. The artist’s reception takes place on Thursday, October 11 from 6-8pm at the agnès b. Galerie Boutique in New York. This will be the first exhibition at the gallery with the New York-based artist who works primarily in painting, sculpture, drawing and photography.

 This new exhibition features an installation that includes more than 30 drawings, ceramics, a large-scale painting, and a 8mm film in which Kulig has invited Aska Matsumiya to develop a soundscape. All of the work captures the nuanced movement of professional boxing. Like dancers, boxers exist in the physical moment—the body is their medium, and every gesture is an articulation of strategy. The end result is exhaustion, and Kulig’s poignant illustrations give the viewer a chance to linger quietly in suspended time. Through ink, pencil, paint and film, the artist honors and toys with the seriousness of boxing. It is only natural that these works—with their reverence for the human form—find a temporary home at the agnès b. Galerie Boutique.

 In mid-October, a 96-page artist book will be published by Pacific on the occasion of the exhibition, with an introduction by Curtis Kulig, an essay by Karen Wong and a story by Max Blagg. A companion vinyl album has been curated by Kulig and collaborator DJ Stretch Armstrong and will be released concurrently.

 Kulig is best known for his iconic “Love Me” campaign that became a public art sensation and propelled him into the spotlight. With its message of hope and optimism, the slogan took on a life of its own, resulting in worldwide recognition and numerous successful commercial partnerships for the artist.

DC Moore Gallery presents Guide, a solo-exhibition of new paintings by Eric Aho. Aho is known for his landscapes that abstract the natural world, and this new body of work, at times both inviting and confrontational, challenges our understanding of depth in a uniquely painterly manner. Many of the works are large in scale, in order to examine the dichotomy of monstrousness and intimacy that can be found in the deep and complicated architecture of the forest. In River Guide, Aho has created a minimalistic river scene, yet the inclusion of a simple horizon line defines the overpowering size of the trees that merge with river. It is frontal, daunting, but simultaneously calming due to the gentle light breaking through the trees and the delicate trace of fishing casting lines that also signify a real and personal experience the artist had there.

 Other works elevate the imaginative, primal nature of the forest by transforming it into patterns of vibrant, expressive color. Walker’s Woods elevates the diverse palette of nature’s brighter hues while the deep blues and grays in Pinewood Nocturne evoke the terrifying mystery and magnificence of the dense forest at night. Aho constructs his paintings around the notion that we can access feelings of pain and beauty through the sensation of awe in being unable to control nature. Through his deft use of enveloping strokes of thick paint that materialize these liminal settings, he has created works that allow the viewer to recall one’s own spiritual encounters in nature. The paintings therefore conjure a feeling of an escape, both contemplative and meditative. In this way, Aho’s landscapes are a necessary and regenerative antidote from the chaotic cultural climate we find ourselves immersed in every day.

 A catalogue with essay by Peter Heller, nature writer and author of Celine, and The Painter will accompany this exhibition and can be viewed here.

 Eric Aho lives and works in Saxtons River, VT. After studying at the Central School of Art and Design in London, Aho received his BFA, and in 1989 participated in the first exchange of scholars between the U.S. and Cuba in over thirty years. Aho completed his graduate work at the Lahti Art Institute in Finland, supported by a Fulbright Fellowship, in 1991-92 and an American-Scandinavian Foundation grant in 1993. His works have recently been exhibited in; “Transcending Nature: Paintings by Eric Aho,” at The Currier Museum of Art, NH; “Eric Aho: Ice Cuts,” at The Hood Museum of Art, NH; “Eric Aho: An Unfinished Point in a Vast Surrounding,” at The New Britain Museum of American Art, CT. His works are collected widely in the United States and abroad and are included in the permanent collections of the Currier Museum of Art, NH; The Denver Art Museum, CO; The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, CA; The Hood Museum of Art, NH; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY; The Museum of Fine Arts, MA; The New Britain Museum of American Art, CT, among others.

Louis K. Meisel Gallery presents Mel Ramos: Superheroes of 1963. Featuring Ramos’ earliest series of Pop works, these paintings depict female icons from pre-Code comic books. Of the 24 original works from this series, Meisel Gallery is proud to be able to present six of his most exciting paintings.

 In 1961, Ramos painted his own versions of Superman, Batman, and the Flash. These works are recognized as Ramos’ first true Pop artworks. Painted in an expressive impasto-style that was imparted by his mentor Wayne Thiebaud, each canvas presents a single character (or a duo) in large-scale on a plain background that is devoid of context and episode. As curator Harvey L. Jones wrote in 1977, “[t]hese paintings are not merely illustrations enlarged to human scale; they are characters removed from their source and placed in a fine arts context.” By elevating low brow imagery to the canvas, Mel Ramos redefined portraiture with a new-found Pop sensibility.

 1963 marked a decided shift in Ramos’ career. By this point, Ramos was exclusively painting portraits of female superheroes after experimenting with some imagery of women in the previous year. Beginning with “Phantom Lady” and closing with the completion of “Cave Girl” in January 1964, he painted 20 female superheroes. Pulling from lesser known comics, Ramos playfully introduced his viewers to characters such as “Señorita Rio - The Queen of the Spies” and “Roma – Empress of the Ancient World”. While Ramos chose to portray these characters at the same scale as the male superheroes, these new works also incorporated the “titles” of the superheroes in their original typography, which created for an attention-grabbing format that would inspire Ramos’ future compositions.

 By this point, his work had caught the eye of Lawrence Alloway who had recently presented “Six Painters and the Object” at the Guggenheim. A celebrated exhibition, the show featured the work of six contemporary New York artists including Warhol, Lichtenstein and Johns. When the show traveled to LACMA in the summer of ‘63, Ramos was chosen by Alloway to be one of six West Coast artists (“Six More”) to round out the exhibition. The landmark LACMA exhibition, coupled with Ramos’ exploration of this new subject matter, helped to launch Ramos’ career far beyond the Bay area.

 Ramos, born in Sacramento, California in 1935, has spent the past six decades experimenting with Pop imagery and the female form. He has had solo exhibitions throughout the United States and internationally. His paintings are in numerous permanent collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Whitney Museum of American Art; and the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, DC, amongst others.

Ruddell’s imagery captures a vivid dream-like world seemingly caught in a temporal flux, where figures act out miraculous feats of levitation and balance. The turbulent nature of the subject matter exposes the viewer to the artist’s metaphysical search for “being and identity” in a politically charged time.

 For these works Ruddell draws on observations of his family relationships, taking note as his children have transitioned from adolescents to adults and recollecting how he, his wife, and their parents, navigated the same passage of time and there after. The paintings capture, in allegory, how different generations traverse the precarious balance of their youthful dreams with reality. In a rather personal piece, A Reckless Dreamer, we see what might amount to a portrait of his son, a filmmaker, whose vision to build is captured in mid-span and in all its messiness.

 Like actual dreams, many paintings in Daydream Believer are open to vast interpretations, but Ruddell also delves into the political. It’s Just Weather, United We Stand, and Against The Tide specifically encourage dialog about current times. The artist states, “They are a means to visualize the now and build the messy bridge towards the future.”

 Ruddell employs dramatic colors and graphic edges that mediate gestural stabs and blurry pulls of paint evocative of hazy memories. There is profound commitment to the act of painting, through which Ruddell frames a world that is both fleeting and eternal.

 Gary Ruddell was born in 1951 in San Mateo, CA. He holds a BA of Fine Arts from California College of the Arts (1975), and is a noted illustrator of science fiction novels. Throughout the 1980s Ruddell was a concept designer for 20th Century Fox where he worked with notable film directors. By the early 1990s Ruddell, ready for a change, made the shift to working exclusively on personal projects. Since, he has exhibited in museums, galleries, and universities throughout the United States.

On a personal level, 2018 has been insanely busy for Richard Barnet and he has turned to drawing and watercolor to visualize and give some coherence to his often-rushed and distracted thoughts. Barnet says of this new work “Monument is a premonition of where the disgraceful state of global politics continues to exist. How I Think is a reflection on my state of mind when I made it this summer. I am interested in symbols and meanings, as well as designs in my work, yet acknowledge that any additional statements about context and content is often best left to others to interpret as they will”.

 Nancy Lunsford continues her portrait work, started last year, to honor and recognize African American and Civil Rights leaders. Her small-scale portraits are done on wood panels with a technique that uses burned and charred mark making. While some well-known figures are shown, most of Nancy’s attention is devoted to those who have not received widespread recognition for their contributions to American history and progress.

 Joy Makon is showing new watercolors done in her studio during the hot summer. “I didn’t have to go too far from home for the inspiration for these two works. A July Sparkler is from my backyard and Local Sunset is from a nearby busy intersection. Both paintings explore the phenomena that occurs when our vision is challenged in both harsh, bright sunlight and during twilight. What we see is filled with ambiguity: details blur into shadows, which blur into darkness. In both works, while I paid close attention to certain forms, the majority of the image is what we think is there, but is only implied.

Allouche Gallery presents Ron English’s Delusionville, an aggressive reinterpretation of pop culture through the eyes of an artist mesmerized by the spectacle of chaos. The 20 plus paintings created over the past three years feature English’s iconic characters navigating metamorphic landscapes and grappling with delusions of ecstasy and heartbreak.

 Also featured is a series of collaborative works from Ron English and Daniel Johnston titled Rival Verses. Johnston, a Texas singer/songwriter/visual artist and English met in Austin in 1983 and over the course of their thirty-plus year friendship have collaborated on art and music numerous times. The pieces included in this exhibition range from 2007 through 2018.

 One of the most prolific and recognizable artists alive today, Ron English has bombed the global landscape with unforgettable images, on the street, in museums, in movies, books and television. English coined the term POPaganda to describe his signature mash-up of high and low cultural touchstones, from superhero mythology to totems of art history, populated with his vast and constantly growing arsenal of original characters, including MC Supersized, the obese fast-food mascot featured in the hit movie “Supersize Me,” and Abraham Obama, the fusion of America’s 16th and 44th Presidents, an image widely discussed in the media as directly impacting the 2008 election. Other characters carousing through English’s art, in paintings, billboards, and sculpture include three-eyed rabbits, udderly delicious cowgirls and grinning skulls, blending stunning visuals with the bitingly humorous undertones of America’s Premier Pop Iconoclast.

We live in a land of weather forecasts and breakfasts that set in. Shat on by Tories,
 shovelled up by Labour. And here we are, we three, perhaps the last island of beauty in the world.
 — Uncle Monty, “Withnail and I”

 Theodore:Art presents an exhibition of 8 years of letterpress work by Michelle Vaughan.

 The exhibition will feature Vaughan’s “100 Tweets,” a group of 100 prints “for those who value the art of type, letterpress, snark and a nicely written tweet.” Vaughan scoured her Twitter feed for 100 comments over a period of 9 months searching for witty or banal comments and even captured political moments which she documented using hand typeset letterpress. Riffing off of Gerhard Richter’s random selection of colors for his grid paintings, Vaughan used an online randomizer to select the Pantone colors for “100 Tweets”, so no two prints are alike. Through the use of a letterpress, Vaughan’s gesture is almost a comical one as she transforms the split second immediacy of Tweeting into a laborious, manual process. Exhibited at the Dumbo Art Center in January 2012, this is the first time the entire set has been shown since then and serves as a curious social media time capsule.

 Vaughan has continued to produce one or two editions a year, including some rather argumentative texts (I KNOW THINGS AND YOU’RE WRONG and I’M RIGHT…), frustration (F*** 2016), and hope for the future (SPARK). Her 2017 edition, RESISTANCE=LOVE, was made in time for the inauguration, and a portion of the proceeds are earmarked for the ACLU Foundation.

 New works made for this exhibit focus on vices, senses and visceral desires to cope with anxiety during this tumultuous political climate we are bombarded with on a daily basis.

 Michelle Vaughan received her BFA at UCLA. Her art practice focuses on political or historical subjects: she examines topics and then deconstructs and reinterprets the material through her work. Vaughan has had solo shows at Dumbo Art Center and the South Street Seaport, where she was awarded fiscal sponsorship from the New York Foundation of the Arts for Sea Warriors: A Public Art Project, in 2009. During the summer of 2018, her ongoing project “Generations” was shown in solo exhibitions at Galería Trinta and the Universidade Santiago de Compostela in Spain. Vaughan was born in Anaheim, California and lives in New York City.

<![CDATA[
Having reduced my palette to black and white in 2012, I am trying, since 2015, to include ambient light in my work, by painting on clear acrylic supports (commonly known as plexiglass), using this material’s transparency, reflective properties, reversibility and plasticity. By adding light to the traditional aspects of abstract painting, I seek to create a visual complexity that speaks of our time in which the screen is everywhere. In this new project, I tried to reintroduce colour in my work, by ways of the support. I was seduced by primary coloured fluorescent plexiglass that throws light on its edges. The challenge was to create a fascination for colour and light that would be mainly pictorial with this material heavily associated with design. Thus, I used the plexiglass as if it was the paint: paying close attention to the specific effects occurring in the material. To make the most out of it, I have given up patterns to favour gradients that occur when a thick coat of acrylic paint gets thinner and let the colour of the panel appear. These gradients alter the colours, make the panels opaque and reduce the quantity of light that gets through them. I created 3D paintings that hang to the wall but juts out into the room to catch surrounding light. Contrasting coloured panels overlap, creating new colours, light effects, and veils. The wall itself, painted black under some paintings, changes their hue and enhance this layering. Reversible, the paintings look contradictory when seen from different sides. However, one can easily mentally deconstruct their components, entirely exposed. This power of a painting to create an illusion, even when its material reality lay bare, is an important part of this project. Between transparency and opacity, illusion and objecthood, these paintings embody contradictions.

 Julie Trudel is a painter living and working in Montreal, Canada. Her practice of abstract painting focuses on the material aspect of colour, trying to reveal it in a brand-new form. She holds a BA, a BFA and an MFA and has taken part in numerous artist residencies. She has exhibited in Europe, in the United States, and across Canada, including recent important survey of Canadian painting Entangled, two views on contemporary Canadian painting at the Vancouver Art Gallery (2017) and The painting project at Galerie de l’UQAM (2013). Trudel was a two-time finalist in the RBC Canadian Painting Competition (2011 and 2012) and the winner of the 2013 Joseph Plaskett Award in painting. She is represented by Galerie Hugues Charbonneau and she is Assistant Professor at Université du Québec à Montréal.

 The Map and the Territory is a group show featuring multiple New York-based artists of varying backgrounds. Each of them has rediscovered both the geographical and conceptual notions of maps, as well the powerless and absurd nature of territories. In presenting the glories and defeats of intercultural communications, the show explores the boundaries between the accessible and the inaccessible, the seen and the unseen, ultimately to question the reality that we live in.

 Featuring works by: Alicja Gaskon, Meir Gal, Mark Amerika, Mitch Patrick, Joyce Kozloff and Bonam Kim

McKenzie Fine Art presents an exhibition of recent abstract paintings by Maureen McQuillan. This will be the artist’s fifth solo exhibition with the gallery.

 McQuillan has long explored the inherent properties of materials in simple, labor-intensive processes. Since 2013 she has focused on a systematic investigation of color relationships, inspired by the way technology mediates the perception of the modern viewer’s experience of color in the world. Working on wood panels, the artist applies clear acrylic polymer over a ground, then adds lines in white ink in a series of controlled gestures. The lines are subsequently suspended and manipulated to create an underlying net of complex folds and undulations. Translucent color is then added according to the artist’s ordered system, with patterns that are unique to each work. This process is repeated in multiple layers, creating paintings up to ¾ inches thick. While McQuillan works according to set rules, the final result is never entirely predictable, as optically unexpected mixtures of color occur as they are layered in the clear medium.

 McQuillan’s exhibition title, Offset Drift, refers to a technical term describing the fluctuation of electric currents or other phenomena that deviate from an expected norm. The artist notes, “As much as I try to follow the rules I made at the outset, my process invariably runs off the rails, and goes off in an unexpected direction. That is not to say I just rely on accidents, because my process is a very directed and restrictive system. It’s just that all plans go awry and all systems go haywire.”

 In her new paintings, there is a wider range of scales than in previous bodies of work, and larger paintings are achieved through the use of multiple panels. The colors are rich, varied and luminous, and patterns create an energetic oscillation; in larger works, strong macroscopic geometries emerge.

 McQuillan has been exhibiting nationally and internationally since the early 1990s. Her work has been reviewed in the New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, and Artnews, among many others. In June 2018, McQuillan’s permanent public art installation, commissioned by the MTA’s Arts &amp; Design program, was unveiled at the elevated 36th Avenue N/W subway station in Astoria. Multiple panels of laminated glass span three sides of the station, creating a colorful and immersive experience for subway commuters.

Studio10 presents Ron Baron’s solo exhibition, Ode to A Void. In this show, Baron’s slip-cast ceramic shoes are presented in a large spiraling swirl in the center of the space. Hrag Vartanian, Editor-in-Chief of Hyperallergic chose Baron’s previous show Beyond-Beyond at Smack Mellon as one of the top 2017 exhibitions in Brooklyn and wrote; “the artist was able to expertly suggest a myriad of narratives that never fully emerge into a coherent whole even as seeds of new narratives suggested themselves throughout. Where did the people go? Are they safe? Who is missing? We don’t know but we feel their loss.”

 Baron’s work is infused with a quiet, somber magic - one that references memory or loss and the temporal nature of moments. The shoes in his installation seem both bound by gravity and freed from it as certain shoes ascend off the floor, hinting at play or a remembered game. Possessed of a ghostlike beauty, the spiraling walk of the shoes mimics the meandering walks of children’s feet that skip and weave through the world observing and taking in. The sculptures also hint at the manner in which absence or loss is a strong presence for those who are left behind. In a place where someone once stood walking a life path, what remains is an empty stark white shoe.

 Born in Springfield, MA, Ron Baron received a BA from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and MFA from the University of California-Davis. Baron has shown his work nationally and internationally since 1989 and completed over 20 public art projects and commissions. Some of his most prominent commissions are with the MTA and Long Island Railroad, Indianapolis International Airport, Board of Education NYC, Department of Cultural Affairs NYC, Alaska International Airport, University of Oregon: Autzen Stadium, the Portland Regional Arts Council and the Department of Cultural Affairs San Jose, CA. He has won numerous awards including New York Foundation for the Arts, National Endowment for the Arts, Pollock-Krasner, Yaddo Endowed Residency and a Lila Wallace Endowed Residency at the Monet Museum in Giverny, France. His work has been included in a variety of books, magazines and newspapers such as the New York Times, Art in America and Along the Way: MTA Arts for Transit. Baron lives in Williamsburg Brooklyn, NY and teaches Sculpture and Ceramics at the School of Visual Arts, NYC.
