<![CDATA[
The Empire roller skating rink was a landmark in Brooklyn from the time it opened its doors in 1941 to its closing day in 2007, as New York City’s last indoor roller rink. Converted from the old Ebbets Field parking garage, Empire was famous as the birthplace of the “Brooklyn Bounce” which would inform the mainstream skate culture and jumpstart the roller disco craze of the 70s and 80s. Locally, it was known as the place where New Yorkers of all ages and backgrounds could come together; where grandparents showed grandchildren their favorite moves and former gang members and Hasidic Jews skated side by side.

<![CDATA[
The centerpiece of Diana Al-Hadid: Delirious Matter at the Bronx Museum will be the monumental sculpture Nolli’s Orders (2012), which references Giambattista Nolli’s landmark 1748 map of Rome, the first of its kind to show the public spaces of the city. In it, publicly accessible buildings are shown as transparent; private structures are rendered as solid. In Nolli’s Orders, Al-Hadid used the same lexicon of voids and solids, transparency and opaqueness, to convey public and private spaces, figure and ground.

 Diana Al-Hadid: Delirious Matter will be shown concurrently with a special commission by the Madison Square Park Conservancy of new sculptural works by Al-Hadid, and it will feature additional works and primary source materials, including a reprinted folio of Nolli’s map and works on paper by old masters from the Metropolitan Museum collection.

Organized by Cougar Vigil &amp; Eva Mayhabal Davis

 BronxArtSpace presents HUMBLE, works from 15 artists from various tribal nations across the US. Their presence and success comes at a crucial moment–amongst the state of urgency in which cultural spaces find themselves to actively acknowledge and contextualize ideas and creation outside the supposed mainstream. With doors being knocked down for artists and curators of color, the soapbox for the complex spectrum of Native Art is here to amplify.

Curated by Margot Yale

 Memory Palace is a group show curated by Margot Yale and featuring the work of Audrée Anid, Jamie Earnest, and Kelly Olshan. The exhibition takes its name from an ancient imaginal technique used by Greco-Roman orators, in which spatial memory of familiar places is considered the most potent mnemonic device. Using the “memory palace,” a subject can memorize the layout of an architectural environment, pairing each physical locus with a distinct fact. The three artists featured in Memory Palace explore this relationship between memory and architectural space.

<![CDATA[
There is one thing I think realism is definitely not, though it is often confused with it, and that is a technique. Technique is a skill you can learn so you don’t have to respond to what you are looking at, you don’t have to be inquisitive about it. If something is real to you, the question becomes, not How do I do that, but What is this phenomenon I’m perceiving? ~Rackstraw Downes

 This will be Downes first solo show since 2014. His steadfast commitment to painting from observation, on site from start to finish, remains tantamount. Among the 11 paintings on view are three interiors of the artist’s living/studio space: two looking to the west (one painted standing, one sitting) and a third looking to the east - every chair, book, light, etc. considered anew, part of a familiar environment seen freshly. The site of three other paintings is an intersection near Columbia Presbyterian Hospital; here Downes turns the ordinary into the extraordinary observing each angle, far, near, north, and south. In an atypical vertical painting, Outdoor Passageway at 15 Rivington, Downes reveals and reveres all, from weeds to A/C units, from ground to sky. In contrast, two Texas paintings are characteristically horizontal (a demand of our West) where the richness of each creosote bush or each power line is delivered with reverence.

 A study accompanies each of the two Texas paintings, while one or more related drawings hang alongside each of the other nine paintings. For Downes, drawings and studies are means to know the site – very much like “successive meetings with a person; you keep discovering more”.

 On Saturday, September 22, 4 – 6PM to celebrate Rackstraw Downes and this exhibition, Rackstraw Downes: a painter, a 40 minute film by Rima Yamazaki will be previewed. Copies of Rackstraw Downes’ Nature and Art are Physical: Writings on Art, 1967-2008, published in 2014 by Richard Milazzo of Edgewise Press, will also be available for the artist to sign. A conversation with Rima, Richard and Rackstraw will follow the film.

 RACKSTRAW DOWNES, born in England in 1939, received his BA from University of Cambridge in 1961and his BFA and MFA from Yale University in 1963 and 1964 respectively. He remained in the United States, becoming a citizen in 1980. He is the recipient of the Guggenheim (1998) and MacArthur (2009) Fellowships, and was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1999). A retrospective, Rackstraw Downes: Onsite Paintings, 1972-2008, was organized by the Parrish Art Museum in 2010. It traveled to the Portland Museum of Art, ME, and the Weatherspoon Museum in Greensboro, NC. His work is in the collections of several museums including The Art Institute of Chicago, The Museum of Modern Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Philadelphia Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Art.

 Notably, he delivered the Ninth Annual Raymond Lecture for the Archives of American Art in 2009; in 2011, he participated in a Wyeth Foundation for American Art Conference at the National Gallery of Art, entitled Landscape in American Art, 1940-2000 where he delivered the address “From There to Here;’ in 2012 he was featured on PBS’s critically acclaimed Art 21 series, and in 2015, he delivered the inaugural Betty Jean &amp; Wayne Thiebaud Endowed Lecture at the University of California, Davis.
 His essays have appeared in The New York Times Book Review, Art in America, ARTnews, and Art Journal. In 2014, Edgewise Press published Nature and Art Are Physical: Writings on Art, 1967-2008 by Rackstraw Downes. A monograph, with essays by Robert Storr, Sanford Schwartz and Rackstraw Downes, was published by Princeton University Press in 2005. Other books include Under the Gowanus and Razor-Wire Journal (Turning the Head Press, 2000); In Relation to the Whole: Three Essays from Three Decades – 1973, 1981, 1996 (Edgewise Press 2004) and the volume of writings he edited in 1979, Fairfield Porter: Art in Its Own Terms, (Reprinted by the MFA, Boston, 2008).

<![CDATA[
David Sandlin is a prolific, critical voice mining the badlands of American culture and history. His allegorical works combine dense and lush imagery with satirical texts and are presented in paintings, prints, installations, artist’s books and comic books. In Age of Enfrightenment, Sandlin wades through the underside of America and its many monsters with his signature theatrical ridicule and the struggle between hope and dread.

 Born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, at 14 Sandlin’s family moved and he grew up in Alabama. He has long been focused on the ambiguous nature of this country. Sandlin’s America is not the fancy urban centers found on the coasts. It is the rural backwaters, the lost highways and sweaty dead-ends of the American Dream. Sandlin often addresses the culture’s hypocritical morality and commercialism through dark humor scenarios and product pitches. In his worlds one is enticed to visit Sinland, shop for Puritanical Novelty Items, take in a show at the EverLust Sin-e-Plex and shake a leg in the Dance Hall of Shame.

 Sometimes Sandlin follows certain protagonists through these hellscapes, such as the Swamp Preacher, Bill Grimm or Carl Bob de Ville. Other works present David himself, attempting to protect his wife, and to teach his son the lessons he will need to survive on his own. The recent paintings in Age of Enfrightenment are populated more by the politicians, monsters, insects, condemned trees and the ghosts of terrorists are reigning over the fall of the American Empire. This is represented literally in scenes where words are shattered over high-cliff waterfalls, and dissolve into the collecting pools of abandon.

 Above many of these paintings hang smaller paintings, slightly haunting scenes of moonlit clouds amid the wafting words of incantations. These, like many of Sandlins’ works, are inspired by Japanese artists such as Taiso Yoshitoshi, particularly his One Hundred Aspects of the Moon series. Yoshitoshi framed the tumult of his Meiji-era world with dramatic clashes of warriors, ghouls, villains and tragic lovers. In similar fashion Sandlin finds himself beset in times where up is down, every soul is for sale, and a once fertile land is full of disease and plague.

 The exhibition coincides with the launch of a major publication on David Sandlin’s artwork. Sleep of History (2018) is published in coordination with the Abroms-Engel Institute for the Visual Arts in Birmingham, Alabama. The books 192 pages include essays by Dennis Harper and John Fields, and a catalog of images of Sandlin’s many paintings, artist’s books, and prints. It will also include an excerpt from Belfaust, Sandlin’s work-in-progress graphic novel set both in Belfast and Birmingham that follows a series of characters with quotidian struggles and a Faustian struggle for identity.

<![CDATA[
GR Gallery presents “Untainted Abstraction”, a duo show featuring artists Emilio Cavallini and Meguru Yamaguchi, collaborating together for the first time. The exhibition will unveil 20 artworks by the two internationally known artists from Italy and Japan. Beside showcasing an unanticipated new body of works, the show will reveal a limited edition print and a 3-d wall sculpture edition, appositely conceived for this event. The artists are also organizing a design planning that will throw the visitor into a timeless world of energetic purity, thanks to an interactive and immersive installation completed by a potent and clean wall painting.

 “Untainted Abstraction” aims to highlight the uncommon esthetic approach to abstraction shared by the two artists. A style focused, through the use of new and trailblazing media, simultaneously on strength and elegance. Both Meguru and Emilio, even if with different concepts and developments, share a mutual background and carrier as fashion designers, that strongly influence their artistic procedure. The echoes of Japanese and Italian historical traditions whisperover their creations, capable to reinterpret this heritage, using cutting edged techniques, sharp and wide open aesthetic visions and an up to date passion for visual details and profound contents. The essential of ancient calligraphy mixes with the power of urban art and the culture of the Renaissance blends with the elegance of the contemporary fashion design.

 The juxtaposition and overlapping of several layers of Nylon yarns, cotton threads and printed fabric, wisely sewed by Emilio Cavallini through an acrylic glass frame gives birth to elegant geometric 3-d compositions, perfectly executed following numerical systems and mathematical formulas, but inspired by the orderly perfection and the color palette of Renaissance Masters like Piero Di Cosimo, Rosso Fiornetino and Pontormo. These creations get engaged in a spontaneous dialogue with Meguru Yamaguchi artistic approach, in which the purity of traditional Japanese calligraphy and the strength of the Gutai group abstraction, mixed with contemporary technology and street culture, inspires an innovative and vibrant technique that transforms the brushstrokes in spotless tridimensional objects.

 Meguru Yamaguchi (Tokyo, 1984).

 He is much more focused on brushstroke, and he transcends and evolves the existing framework of canvas.Through the technique of what he calls Cut &amp; Paste, Yamaguchi achieves a uniquely chaotic, vibrantly intense and visually robust abstraction on various surfaces. The method entails laying out paints on plastic sheets to dry, then peeling it off and pasting them onto another surface as if collaging to create shapeless shapes and formless forms.His timeless and elegant style brought him naturally into the fashion world, working as a designer for famous brands such as Issey Miyake, Nike and Uniqlo.

 He has been collaborating with US brands such asAudi, Stussy, FTC, ALIFE, and Chari&amp;Co NYC. He has participated in numerous exhibitions including shows at Kinfolk 94, +81 gallery in NY, Ace Hotel NY, Hidari Zingaro and HHH gallery in Tokyo.

 Emilio Cavallini (Florence, 1945).

 Since the mid-sixties he dedicates himself to his greatest passions and his work emerges in an innovative and original way, linking art and fashion. Through the years his innovative style leads him to collaborate with Mary Quant, Dior, Celine, Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, Alexander McQueen and Gucci. Celebrities are very supportive of his work : Madonna, Beyonce’, Lady Gaga and many more are spotted wearing Emilio Cavallini hosiery.

 While in the fashion world he gains notoriety as a designer, he starts to create important artwork to fulfill his own personal interests. Emilio uses unconventional materials for his art, materials borrowed from the fashion world: nylon yarns, printed fabrics, his own tights, yarn’s reels, and his artist research is founded on geometry and mathematics. Dots, lines, squares, triangles, circles are settled in a 3 D environment. Everything follows combinatorial principles, permutations, growth algorithms and the most recent mathematical-geometrical theories, as you can see from his artwork titles. His works were exhibited in Art Galleries and Museums all over the world.

<![CDATA[
Navigating the social structure of the schoolyard is fraught with trauma for many young people, a reality that is not lost on Phoenix-based painter Colin Chillag. For his first solo show in New York, Chillag finds focus in the concept of being nobody, a take on both the Buddhist inspired interpretation of nothingness, and the Nihilistic comfort of powerlessness. Working from found photographs, Chillag turns his deconstructed style towards somewhat delicate subject matter — the faces of local school children. In one part of this series of paintings, yearbook portrait-like in their composition, Chillag distorts the features of five young girls, each of their bright eyes made hauntingly inhuman through his methodological build up of paint and dark, scratchy color. The skin of several girls is almost waxen in it’s visual quality, adding another layer of disassociation to the portraits.

 In the past Chillag has described his penchant for abstracting his otherwise hyperrealist works with glitching, over-laid lines and unfinished edges as “like a child drawing on a photograph.” This idea is given a new understanding when applied directly to the subject matter of children. The group paintings are reminiscent of digitally altered computer images, their large swaths of flat color dragged across the canvas, as if with a paintbrush tool. Passing under the radar is a survival tactic for many young people, and in many cases Chillag honors this by literally erasing faces from the group. For It’s Important to be Nobody, Chillag’s hyperrealism is pushed into the computer age, yielding a series that is at once off-putting and captivating — a contradiction not unlike the central thesis of his most recent work.

 Colin Chillag was born in Syracuse, NY in 1971. He received his BFA from the San Francisco Art Institute in 1993. His work has been exhibited throughout the United States in venues such as the Phoenix Art Museum, the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art and The Mesa Contemporary Arts Museum, AZ . Recently he was the recipient of the Mid-Career Artist Award from the Phoenix Art Museum. Chillag’s works are in the permanent collections of Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art and Arizona State University Art Museum. His work has been both featured or reviewed in a variety of publications including Modern Painter, Art in America, and the Los Angeles Times. He is featured in the permanent collection in the Arizona State University Art Museum, Tempe, AZ; Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art, Scottsdale, AZ; University of Arizona Art Museum, Tucson, AZ; Treg Bradley Collection, Scottsdale, AZ; and the Zabludowicz Collection, London, UK.

<![CDATA[
The Tibor de Nagy Gallery presents Oh, What Fun! an exhibition of John Ashbery’s collages made from 2015 until his death in September 2017. This will be Ashbery’s fourth solo exhibition at the gallery and his first at the gallery’s Rivington Street location.

 Oh, What Fun! consists of group of works inspired, as with his previous collages, by Ashbery’s long held fascinations, many since childhood, with cartoons, movies and other forms of popular culture. Much of the imagery and source material is culled from his personal trove of collections, such as board games, French puzzle plates, old postcards, and other treasured knick-knacks that fill his homes in Manhattan and Hudson, New York. Ashbery became interested at a young age by surrealism, particularly the collage novels of Max Ernst and the work of Kurt Schwitters and Joseph Cornell. A more direct and collaborative influence was his friend Joe Brainard, at times making collages side-by-side with him in Brainard’s house in Vermont and sharing found materials for future collages. Although Ashbery started making collages as an undergraduate at Harvard with one appearing on the cover of the Harvard Advocate in 1948 (a collaboration with Fred Amory), and he first publicly exhibited a single collage in a group exhibition at the Drawing Center in 1977, it has only been in the last decade that his collages have become more widely known.

 John Ashbery is recognized as one of the most important American poets of modern times, and his approach to poetry and collage follow parallel tracks. Often in an Ashbery poem, the sentences and phrases accumulate into abstract “collages” that cannot easily be paraphrased or explained. This practice of incorporating collage elements into his poetry began as far back as 1952. A more recent example of this creative process is the poem They Knew What They Wanted (link) composed of movie titles beginning with the word “They.” Another earlier poem is Hoboken, published ca. 1953, subtitled (A collage made from Roget’s Thesaurus). In the poem Daffy Duck in Hollywood (link), Ashbery pulls together many disparate elements into a loose narrative. As fellow poet John Yau states in a recent interview with him: ”In some ways, your Manhattan apartment and Hudson house are like the list in Daffy Duck in Hollywood, full of all kinds of things next to each other.” To which Ashbery answers: “Yes, I’m firmly eclectic in these and in most things.”

 The exhibition also celebrates the poet’s long association with the gallery and marks the 65th anniversary of the publication of Ashbery’s first volume of poetry Turandot and Other Poems, which was published by the gallery’s Tibor de Nagy Editions in 1953.

 Concurrent with the gallery’s show is a major exhibition of Ashbery’s collages at the Pratt Institute’s Manhattan Gallery (link) titled John Ashbery: The Construction of Fiction, which opens on September 20, and runs until November 14, 2018. This will be the most comprehensive exhibition of the poet’s visual art to date, spanning seven decades of work and presenting over 120 collages and archival material. The exhibition is curated by Antonio Sergio Bessa, Director of Curatorial Programs at the Bronx Museum of the Arts. Bessa, who co-organized the recent Martin Wong exhibition at the Bronx Museum and the Gordan Matta-Clark exhibition at the Jeu de Paume, Paris, is a scholar of concrete and visual poetry and a translator of Brazilian poetry. A fully illustrated catalogue will accompany the exhibition.

 A book on John Ashbery’s collages and poetry was recently published by Rizzoli/Electa – John Ashbery: They Knew What They Wanted, Poems and Collages, edited by Mark Polizzotti, with an introduction and interview by John Yau.

 John Ashbery (1927-2017) had more than thirty collections published in his lifetime. His Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror (1975) won the three major American prizes – the Pulitzer, the National Book Award, and the National Book Critics Circle Award. He served as executive editor of Art News and as an art critic for New York magazine and Newsweek. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he was a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets from 1988 to 1999. He received two Guggenheim Fellowships and was a MacArthur Fellow from 1985 through 1990. In 2012, Ashbery was awarded a National Humanities Medal by President Obama.

<![CDATA[
I send back to the West that which belongs to them, which is to say, the refuse of consumer society that invades us every day.
 —Romuald Hazoumè

 Gagosian presents an exhibition of works by Romuald Hazoumè, bringing together sculptures from 1997 to the present. This is Gagosian’s second exhibition of Hazoumè’s work following a 2016 show in Paris, and his first solo exhibition in New York since 1999.

 Hazoumè’s art—which ranges across sculpture, photography, film, and sound—absorbs and confronts the complex realities of contemporary life in Benin and the broader ramifications of Pan-African politics. A bricoleur whose formal currency is often found in recycled materials—for example, the fifty-liter plastic bidon, or jerrycan, a local staple for the illegal purchase of cheap gasoline from Nigeria—Hazoumè uses strategies of repetition and recombination to create works of elegant potency whose effects are intensified by the wordplay of his titles.

 Masks are perhaps the best-known aspect of Hazoumè’s art. In Yoruba culture, masks have long had ceremonial and symbolic importance, as the head and the face are often regarded as the locus of a person’s destiny. Highly valued by European markets, African masks became recurring motifs in the artwork of the twentieth-century European avant-gardes. Freed from ritual or sociological purpose, Hazoumè’s masks consciously adapt the signifiers of African-European exchange to contemporary realities. Composed of plastic gasoline containers and other discarded materials, the masks are freighted with subtext, bringing to mind the Beninese men and women who, unable to find legal employment, are forced to ferry contraband gasoline between Nigerian sources and their Beninese consumers in order to survive.

<![CDATA[
The machine perpetuates its binary beat.
 —Federico García Lorca, “Ode to Salvador Dalí” (1926)

 Play is the origin of fiction.
 —Urs Fischer

 Gagosian presents PLAY, conceived by Urs Fischer with choreography by Madeline Hollander.

 At the intersection of sculpture, behavior, and choreography, PLAY is an arena of chance encounters where visitors are invited to interact with nine office chairs that seem to have lives of their own.

 Play, a ritual older than humankind, has set rules that distinguish it from reality, but it has no clear aim or value other than itself. Instead, it is merely a feedback loop, a push/pull of energy, bound by time and place. Accordingly, the chairs seem to behave in such ways as to belie some level of predictability—only to then debunk the illusion.

 The more the viewer seeks to control the chairs, the clearer it becomes that they are not pawns or pets but participants. By attempting to understand the choreography, we actually create it, enacting the very patterns that we wish to decode.

Brennan &amp; Griffin presents Blasted Rockface, an exhibition of new paintings by LA based artist JP Munro.

 Referencing the dynamited sloped highway paths in the mountains of north Los Angeles, the title of the exhibition shares its name with the sole plein-air landscape painting among the works presented. Acting as a metaphorical entry point for his newest body of work, Munro mines art historical, biblical and mythological subjects that suggest allegorical interpretations and moral lessons. These subjects and narratives are re-deployed by Munro in complex personal visions that unfold simultaneously, ranging from the quasi-heroic to the mundane.

 One of three large works in the show, Suicide of Saul, reinterprets Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s 15th century painting of the same title. Both paintings depict the biblical account of Saul, King of Israel falling on his sword in order to avoid capture by the Philistines. Munro’s rendition of the painting shares with Bruegel’s a preoccupation with the landscape as it overtakes the epic battle scene and depicts a historical event unfolding while the wider world carries on as normal. A tent village, exotic plants and minuscule figures in imagined ancient costumes are rendered in Byzantine detail, barely discernible within dense layers of staccato brushstrokes of varying shades of green that make up the broad expanse of hills, forests and valleys within the painting.

 The two other large works in the exhibition call into question the hierarchy of categories and the relative importance of the personal and the collective. Couple by a Pool, takes its central subject from two minutely rendered figures in Suicide of Saul. Munro enlarges the peripheral figures of the previous painting and they become the focal point of the composition. The figures’ extraction from a grand historical scene is re-contextualized within what is resolutely a genre painting. Fall of the Rebel Angels is an amalgamation of a number of historical paintings, all featuring angels being cast out of heaven. A maelstrom of torqued bodies and hybrid figures recalling heavy-metal art fill the canvas, writhing and tumbling across a searing yellow field. The historical narratives associated with the figures are transformed through Munro’s personal and idiosyncratic vision.

 JP Munro lives and works in Los Angeles, CA. He has held solo exhibitions at China Art Objects, Los Angeles, CA and Sadie Coles HQ, London, England. Notable group exhibitions include Human Nature, LACMA, Los Angeles, CA, 2006 Whitney Biennial, Whitney Museum of Art, New York, NY, and Defamation of Character, MoMA PS1, Queens, NY. Collections include the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Los Angeles, the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, the Whitney Museum of Art, New York, NY, and the Henry Art Museum, Seattle, WA. This is his first exhibition with the gallery.

frosch&amp;portmann presents Fountain, the gallery’s fourth solo exhibition by New York based artist Vicki Sher.

 A light in the moon the only light is on Sunday. What was the sensible decision. The sensible decision was that notwithstanding many declarations and more music, not even notwithstanding the choice and a torch and a collection, notwithstanding the celebrating hat and a vacation and even more noise than cutting, notwithstanding Europe and Asia and being overbearing, not even notwithstanding an elephant and a strict occasion, not even withstanding more cultivation and some seasoning, not even with drowning and with the ocean being encircling, not even with more likeness and any cloud, not even with terrific sacrifice of pedestrianism and a special resolution, not even more likely to be pleasing. The care with which the rain is wrong and the green is wrong and the white is wrong, the care with which there is a chair and plenty of breathing. The care with which there is incredible justice and likeness, all this makes a magnificent asparagus, and also a fountain.

 —From Tender Buttons (1914) by Gertrude Stein

 Vicki Sher’s exhibition takes its title from the last word of Gertrude Stein’s Tender Buttons. In this final paragraph of the book, Stein’s typically inscrutable prose seems to describe a world where everything’s all wrong. Declarations are wrong, current events are wrong, Europe and Asia, and green are wrong, oceans are circling an unsettling landscape of problems big and small, intimate and worldly. But then, in the end, there is hope in Nature. There is the absurd and remarkable existence of asparagus, and the continual human desire to shape Nature for our own experience of joy (a fountain). What is bigger than current events is Nature (and Beauty, color and shape), and that is the last word.

 FOUNTAIN features one large scale installation collage entitled “A Day in The Life of the Moon”, and smaller works on drafting film, that use a language of geometric shapes to describe the feeling of being in nature.

Galerie Richard presents ‘Builds’ a solo show by Carl Fudge. “Builds” examines the process of construction through the act of building an image, Fudge is interested in the failures and glitches experienced with digital media as he examines the coexistence of the material physical world and the immateriality of the digital realm.

 In previous works, Fudge digitally manipulated historical graphic works (such as Japanese ukiyo-e prints, religious woodcuts of Durer, camouflage prints of Warhol and industrial scenes in prints by Edward Wadsworth). He built and deconstructed multiple layers of iconography giving new significance to the old. This series of works marks a departure as he focuses on the visual essence of a digital image - the pixel.

 Fudge presents a series of black monochromes and allows us to see that a monochrome is a concept. The digital image is a construction of the mind, an interpretation of a more complex visual reality. These works are made with different textures of black sandpaper, meticulously cut into squares and assembled on a wood panel. Sandpaper a tool employed in building used for both construction and deconstruction. The process is both random and repetitive. The resulting appearance resembles a low-resolution digital field of color, where the image is experienced as a jigsaw of varying shades of one hue. The illusion is created through the different grades of the sandpaper having a varying density of black grit. This juxtaposition between the physical materiality of the sandpaper and the suggestion of the immateriality of the digital realm provides a compelling contradiction.

 Fudge works with different size paintings, but more importantly, works with different size units. From a painting with very small squares, he will zoom in on a detail x 2 and will make a new painting. Then he continues to zoom in on a detail x2 again and will make a third one and so on. Fudge’s practice has always accented the process of repetition and elaboration of his artworks, a trait inherent in the printed medium which he often employs.

 Part of the exhibition is dedicated to two new series of prints hand printed by the artist. A set of woodcuts that resemble digital static or QR codes are both an amusing and absurd subject to be represented in this most ancient form of information dissemination and communication. The other is a series of screen prints, that also allude to representations of digital malfunction. Using the grid as a starting point each print develops into a unique impression. With these new series of works, Carl Fudge makes his own unique signature as a major digital artist of this generation.

 Born in London in 1962, Fudge has been living in New York since graduate school, he has been exhibiting with Galerie Richard since 2003.
 His works are in the collections of The Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY, The Brooklyn Museum of Art, New York, NY, The Boston Museum of Arts, Boston, MA, The Seattle Art Museum, Seattle, WA, The Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia, PA, The Denver Museum of Art, Denver, CO amongst others and in Corporate collections such as Deutsche Bank and Sprint Corporation.

 Foley Gallery and Scott Hunt present You Tell Me, a group exhibition featuring works by more than 15 contemporary artists whose practice speaks to the narrative.

 We are given a proposal…a scene, a set of characters, a prop, a mood. Some circumstances, without apparent cause, that are leading us to believe…what?

 The artists in this exhibition keep the plot lines open. As viewers, we come to the scene, applying our own framework, filling in the spaces that the artist cannot or will not provide.

 Narrative can imply a story arc, a protagonist, a resolution. Here, we have fragments, false leads, and subtext. Let the viewer piece what they can together and collaborate these to their own conclusions.

 About the Curators:

 As a fine artist whose discipline is drawing, Scott Hunt produces charcoal and pastel works on paper that are narrative and/or allegorical in nature.

 Hunt has had seven solo shows in the U.S. and Europe and has been included in many group exhibitions including most recently, “Really?,” a show of contemporary realism curated by the esteemed American collector, Beth Rudin deWoody. He is the recipient of the 2017 FID Prize for Drawing, as well as a Fellowship from The New York Foundation for the Arts (NYFA) and a grant from The Pollock-Krasner Foundation. His drawings are part of the permanent collection of contemporary art at The Israel Museum, Jerusalem and The Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, Los Angeles.

 Michael Foley opened his gallery in the fall of 2004 after fourteen years of working with notable photography galleries including Fraenkel Gallery, Howard Greenberg Gallery, and Yancey Richardson Gallery. After 8 years in Chelsea, the gallery has relocated to the LES, taking a storefront location on Orchard Street, just south of Delancey

 He is on the faculty of the School of Visual Arts and the International Center of Photography where he teaches and lectures on issues in contemporary photography.

Cristin Tierney Gallery presents Under Construction: Photography, Video, and the (Re)presentation of Identity. Examining human nature through the lens of recorded images, this exhibition includes photography and single-channel video works spanning the 1970s to the present by Janet Biggs, Victor Burgin, peter campus, Neil Goldberg, Malia Jensen, Anselm Kiefer, Martha Rosler, and Cindy Sherman.

 Questions of how we perceive ourselves and how we relate to others have long been explored in the visual arts. In Cindy Sherman’s iconic Untitled Film Still #32 from 1979, the artist assumes a pose evoking a movie scene. Commenting on the often-stereotypical way women were presented in the media (and thus the way many felt obliged to look or behave), Sherman purposefully makes the image ambiguous, without a clear narrative. Familiar visual tropes suggest recognition where there is none; a copy of an original that never actually existed. From that same era, peter campus’ straight-on, closely cropped Polaroid photographs of nameless faces use light and shadow to suggest emotional states that may or may not have ever existed. Facing the subjects, the audience’s viewpoint is the same as that of the camera lens. Without any context for guidance, the photographs become psychological portraits—charged surfaces onto which each viewer projects his or her own interpretations.

 More recent works in Under Construction continue these investigations, but in the context of today’s screen-obsessed, media-driven society. In Neil Goldberg’s photo series The Gay Couples of Whole Foods, the artist photographs pairs of men he assumes to be gay as they emerge from a Whole Foods supermarket. Goldberg’s photographs engage various stereotypes about gay men, especially preconceived notions about appearance, lifestyle, and shopping habits. The artist additionally uses the images to excavate his own discomfort with shopping at Whole Foods, which he feels reinforces the grocery chain’s cultural value and carefully composed corporate image.

 Among the video selections in the exhibition is The Bear’s Progress by Malia Jensen, in which a bear embarks on a quest to find himself in the wild. Human nature and our own “animalness” is humorously investigated in the work, as seen through the eyes of a bear—actually an oversized costume worn by the artist. The bear undertakes an all too familiar search for love and companionship, encountering such transformational hallmarks as drugs, sex, death, and conflict along the way.

 Whether historic or recent, still or moving image, all of the artists in Under Construction deliberately subvert long-held narratives that dictate how we look and what we see. In so doing, they demonstrate how all images are carefully managed, wholly subjective constructions, often presented as recorded, objective reality.

Alexander Gray Associates presents its first exhibition of work by Frank Bowling OBE, RA (b.1934). Born in British Guiana, Bowling maintains studios in London and New York. For over five decades, his practice has been defined by its integration of autobiography and postcolonial geopolitics into abstraction. Featuring a selection of recent work, the presentation celebrates Bowling’s contributions to the field of painting.

 Bowling first came to prominence in the early 1960s while still a student at the Royal College of Art in London. Graduating at the height of the British Pop movement, his early work combined representation with gestural applications of paint. After moving to New York in 1966, he immersed himself in post-war American art, producing his semi-figurative Map Paintings (1967–71) before fully embracing abstraction with his series of Poured Paintings (1973–78). A talented and incisive writer, he became a contributing editor to Arts Magazine, drafting insightful texts on artistic production and race. Friends with artists like Melvin Edwards and Jack Whitten, Bowling was also mentored by the art critic Clement Greenberg, and the formal innovation of his practice builds on the legacy of Abstract Expressionism and Color Field Painting.

 In recent work, Bowling continues to hone his approach to abstraction. Playing with color and texture, he synthesizes more than a half-century of painterly techniques. Expanding on the dynamic swaths of acrylic of his 1970s Poured Paintings, these intricate compositions juxtapose gestural drips and slides of pigment against collaged surfaces that refine the accreted roughness of the artist’s 1980s reliefs. Through the use of printed canvas, fabric, and seams, Bowling recalls his mother—a dress designer, embroiderer, and general store owner—incorporating autobiography into the formalist rigor of abstraction.

 At the same time, in paintings like Elder Sun Benjamin (2018), which features stacked planes of color, Bowling evokes the presence of both horizons and borders. Inviting comparisons to the Romantic landscapes of Turner and the striped compositions of Barnett Newman and Jasper Johns, these works imbue abstraction with allusions to observed reality, inviting discourses on the natural world and the complex intertwining of geography and territory. However, Bowling insists, “I do not want to illustrate anything, but to make the paint dance. … The paint does its own thing, spreads and bleeds and then suggests images.” Reveling in color and geometry, Frank Bowling reveals the artist’s masterful ability to “make the paint dance” as he continues to question the nature of abstraction and the possibilities of painting.

 A major retrospective of Bowling’s work organized by Tate Britain, London, United Kingdom will open in 2019. His paintings have been the subject of numerous one-person exhibitions, including Mappa Mundi, curated by Okwui Enwezor, Haus der Kunst, Munich, Germany (2017), traveled to Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, Ireland (2018) and Sharjah Art Foundation, United Arab Emirates (2018); Dallas Museum of Art, TX (2015); Drop, Roll, Slide, Drip… Frank Bowling’s Poured Paintings 1973–8, Tate Britain, London, United Kingdom (2012); Frank Bowling Works on Paper, Royal Academy of Arts, London (2011); Serpentine Gallery, London (1986); and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York (1971). His work has been included in countless group exhibitions, including Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power, Tate Modern, London, United Kingdom (2017), traveled to Crystal Bridges, Bentonville, AR (2018) and Brooklyn Museum, New York (2018); Postwar-Art between the Pacific and Atlantic 1945–65, Haus der Kunst, Munich (2016); Caribbean: Crossroads of the World, Perez Art Museum, Miami (2014); and Witness: Art and Civil Rights in the Sixties, Brooklyn Museum, New York (2014). He has been the recipient of many grants and awards, including an OBE: Order of the British Empire (2008); Membership to the Royal Academy of Art, United Kingdom (2005); two Pollock Krasner Awards (1998, 1992); Arts Council of Great Britain Award (1977); and two John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowships (1973, 1967). His work is included in innumerable private and public collections, including the Arts Council of Great Britain; Dallas Museum of Art, TX; Guyana National Collection, Castellani House, Georgetown, Guyana; Herbert F. Johnson Museum, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY; Menil Foundation, Houston, TX; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA; National Gallery of Jamaica, Kingston, Jamaica; National Museum Wales, Cardiff, United Kingdom; Royal Academy of Arts, London, United Kingdom; Tate Gallery, London; Victoria and Albert Museum, London; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York. Frank Bowling is also represented by Hales Gallery, London and Marc Selwyn Fine Art, Los Angeles

Sikkema Jenkins &amp; Co. presents a solo exhibition of new paintings by Luiz Zerbini, on view at the gallery from September 6 through October 13, 2018. This is the artist’s second show at the gallery.

 Luiz Zerbini is among Brazil’s most prominent living artists. His wide-ranging practice includes sculpture, collage, installation, prints, and even music compositions and sound pieces as a member of the noise band Chelpa Ferro, but he is best known for his colorful works on canvas which range from abstract paintings through to landscapes, cityscapes, and domestic scenes.

 The present exhibition features a mostly abstract body of work, in which Zerbini, a constant innovator, continues to experiment with painting techniques resulting in novel visual effects. While maintaining the modernist grid (a characteristic of his abstract work) as an organizing principal, Zerbini introduces new circular geometries in works like Vênus, Saturno, and the large-scale painting, Macaé. The linear and curvilinear areas overlap and intersect resulting complex forms filled with vivid color and texture. In Doce Rio Zerbini uses a similar combination geometry but to different ends. Here he has painted stalks of bamboo growing from the intersection of grid lines around which a series of circles radiate as if ripples in water.

 Luiz Zerbini, born in São Paulo in 1959, currently lives and works in Rio de Janeiro. He has had a series of retrospective exhibitions at Galpão Fortes Vilaca, São Paulo, Brazil (2015); Casa Daros, Rio de Janeiro (2014); Instituto Inhotim, Minas Gerais (2013) and the Museu de Arte Moderna in Rio de Janeiro (2012). He took part in the Biennials of São Paulo (2010, 1987), Mercosul (2001), Havana (2000) and Cuenca (1996). As a member of Chelpa Ferro, he also participated in the 25th and 26th Biennials of São Paulo. South London Gallery recently presented Intuitive Ratio, Zerbini’s first institutional solo exhibition on the UK.

Joshua Liner Gallery presents Felipe Pantone’s inaugural solo exhibition with the gallery, Transformable Systems. Presenting work from both new and ongoing series, this exhibition showcases Pantone’s futuristic style characterized by bright gradients of color and optical patterns.

 Felipe Pantone, an Argentina-born artist, exploits an ultra-modern aesthetic as a way to “evoke a digital experience through inanimate objects” and integrates technology into the realm of fine art. As a “child of the internet era,” Pantone’s work revolves around transformation, dynamism, and impermanence. Each of the works in Transformable Systems partially employs mechanical-based processes as a means to investigate digital culture’s transient and pervasive nature, while also rendering it accessible and engaging.

 Pantone’s abstract compositions often feature enlarged pixels, QR codes, and grids, exposing the digital mechanisms of production. His work re-examines our digital age and the ways we understand visual information. Reducing his subject to the basic building blocks of image creation allows the artist to call attention to the structure of digital imagery, while finding ways to stand out in our over-digitized world. The artist creates dynamic movement by manipulating color across the x-y plane in the Chromadynamica series. A temporary layer of acrylic installed in front of the painting blurs the bright and colorful pixels, transforming the original work into something new. Works in the Subtractive Variability series have similar registers of color, however, this group is produced with mechanical intervention. Pantone applies cyan, magenta, and yellow UV inks directly onto an aluminum panel using an industrial printer. By moving the panel during the printing process, the artist gains some control over the random interaction between colors. The Optichromie series combines both mechanical and non-mechanical modes of production to explore the visual mechanics of televisions, smartphones, and computers. The gradients and psychedelic accents that characterize these three separate but related bodies of work attempt to capture the dynamism and speed distinctive of 21st Century digital media.

 In his practice, Pantone aims to create art that reflects the way we consume information. Traditionally, visual technologies operate as closed systems, transmitting one-way visual and auditory signals, whereas, Pantone encourages open systems for viewer interactions. Viewers can physically engage with Subtractive Variability Manipulable and Subtractive Variability Circular 2, changing their infinite color dynamics. In this sense, Pantone adds a personable side to technology, a place often described as alienating and cold.

 Pantone’s electric style fuses Kinetic Art’s real and/or apparent motion with Op Art’s jarring optical illusions. Some of Pantone’s inspirations include artists Jesús Rafael Soto and Victor Vasarely. He is especially influenced by Venezuelan artist, Carlos Cruz-Diez, whose color and line investigates a participatory visual experience. Planned Iridescence CNFG applies Cruz-Diez’s moiré effect that produces the sensation of vibration as the viewer’s position changes in relation to the painting. Pantone compares this effect to digital experience, stating, “Movement is activated by the viewer’s position in front of the work creating an individual experience that I perceive as cyber encounters.”

 Technology plays a vital role in Pantone’s process. It is a tool analogous to a paintbrush or a pencil. Pantone asserts, “There’s always a bit of hand manipulation involved in every technology: to paint with a pencil, or ultimately to press the button of a UV printer, for instance.” Technology is not devoid of human interaction. Until systems are fully automated, the human hand will be required to code, program, build, and operate the technologies that impact our daily lives. Pantone’s work urges us to consider the relationship between artistic production and technology, drawing on our concerns of the digital age and the speed at which technology is developing.

 Felipe Pantone was born in Argentina. He studied fine art in Valencia, Spain and gained an international reputation under the name of Pantone. His vibrant work is visible around the world in Mexico City, Osaka, Lisbon, Moscow, Palestine, Italy, Australia, and United States. His murals have been commissioned by: Facebook HQ, Menlo Park, CA; Citadium, Paris, France; Skullerud Train Station, Oslo, Norway; Palibex HQ, Madrid, Spain; Hard Rock Stadium, Miami, FL; and Palms Casino Resort, Las Vegas, NV. Pantone’s work has been included in exhibitions at such institutions as Mesa Contemporary Arts Center, Mesa, AZ; Long Beach Museum of Art, Long Beach, CA; and the Palais de Tokyo, Paris, France.

The Myth of Inanna, a solo exhibition of new work by Alison Blickle.

 A lover of mythology and a practicing witch, Blickle created this work as an homage to the myth of Inanna, the oldest recorded human story. In this Sumerian tale, Inanna descends to the dark of the underworld, loses herself in every sense, and is ultimately reborn wiser and stronger.

 Blickle will be included in the upcoming group exhibition, Blessed Be: Mysticism, Spirituality, and the Occult in Contemporary Art, opening in September at MOCA Tucson, curated by Ginger Shulick Porcella. Her work has been exhibited at the Nassau County Museum of Art, Torrance Art Museum, Deitch Projects, and The Hole.

Bortolami presents Daniel Buren’s Tondi, a series of situated works composed of steel, multi-colored acrylic, mirror, and white 8.7 cm stripes.

 The Tondi were initially exhibited at Le Centquatre-Paris in France in 2015, and subsequently at the Museo de Arte Moderno in Bogota, Colombia, in 2017

. In their new, third configuration at Bortolami, they are situated within the specific architecture of the gallery. A limited-edition, fully- illustrated publication with texts by artist Liam Gillick and curator Annie Wischmeyer will accompany the exhibition.

 The gallery will simultaneously present the new documentary film on Buren’s work, Beyond time, as far as the eye can see. The six-and-a-half-hour film organizes his expansive career in several segments, each focusing on a specific aspect of his work, and functions as a comprehensive cinematic catalogue. Conceived to be viewed in chapters, the film will be screened in the viewing room daily from 11:00am to 5:30pm.

 In his over 50-year career, Daniel Buren is best known for his use of contrasting stripes as a visual tool that reveals the specific features and dimensions of a site, often transforming the environment for which it was specifically designed. He alters the perception and context of one’s surroundings by modifying the navigation of space, enhancing lighting, obstructing viewpoints, and highlighting certain architectural features. Buren constructs his work—much of which is temporary—in the architecture of both public and private spaces ranging from subway platforms to museums.

 Work in situ - “denotes a work made for a particular site, for a particular time and exhibited in this particular site, and therefore not transportable to another place.” Buren has also identified himself as an artist who “lives and works in situ.”

 Situated work - “a work for the most part inspired by a particular location, but made with the intention that the very same elements of the original work can be reinstalled in different sites following a series of rules, changing each time in response to the given place. In turn, the site is changed by the work.”

 Visual tool - the sign of white and color alternating stripes of exactly 8.7 cm. in width, as derived from the fabric he first used as a canvas in 1965. This functions as a tool in Buren’s work, as a standard or unit of measure of formal properties. Significantly, it is also an intended sign that serves as a constant within the wildly variable parameters and juxtapositions of any and all in situ and situated work since 1965 without exception.

 Daniel Buren (b. 1938) has been the subject of major museum exhibitions worldwide. His work is also included in prestigious private and public collections around the globe. Buren has exhibited in the Venice Biennale more than 10 times and was awarded the Golden Lion in 1986. He participated in documenta 5, 6, and 7. In 2007, he received the Praemium Imperiale for Painting from Japan and was selected to exhibit at MONUMENTA 2012 at the Grand Palais in Paris. He has been the subject of large-scale, solo exhibitions at Centre Pompidou in Málaga, Metz, and Paris, Guggenheim Bilbao and New York, among countless other institutions. Daniel Buren lives and works in situ.

Alex Dodge’s latest paintings explore the promise of technology as it interacts with and shapes human experience. His imagery is generated in 3D-rendering programs and applied to canvas with thick oil paint locating his work between new media and traditional materials. Over the past few years the subject of Dodge’s work has ranged from the front page of The New York Times to dollar bills to the American flag. Recently his work was included in Painting in the Network: Algorithm and Appropriation, curated by Chris Reitz at University of Louisville’s Cressman Center fore the Arts, and Vanishing Points, curated by Andrianna Campbell at James Cohan Gallery. The Pizzuti Collection exhibited a survey of Dodge’s practice dating from 2005 to the present in a two-person show retrospective with Glen Baldridge. Alex Dodge has become a central figure among his peers; this year he founded INTERchange, a lecture series featuring artists whose work intersects with technology.

 Alex Dodge lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. His work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Museum of Fine Arts Boston. His work has been reviewed in Artforum, Artnews, Hyperallergic, and Even Magazine among other publications.

“It dissipates faster than our eyes can record…”
 — from “Notes to J.A.,” Tim Dlugos


 I’d like to consider the power of smallness and the informal, the peripheral, the unfinished. Subtle like the ‘b’ in subtle.

 In this exhibition, one of the key themes is the interactions among media and disciplines. Collisions across media — watercolor, graphite and paint on found paper — are mirrored in resonances across disciplines: the meeting points of art, poetry, music.

 I’m employing several methods I’ve used in the past, such as drawings made with a one-hour time limit and drawings from memory in which I first make a copy drawing of a found image and then draw the image a second time from memory. The two drawings are displayed side by side. There are new approaches too, that have to do with the deterioration of representation or representation abstracted. For example, a watercolor inspired by an experience of seeing a film by Nathaniel Dorsky: as I was watching a scene in which a picture of Buddha hangs from a line of string and gently moves in a breeze, the film suddenly began to melt. I heard Nathaniel Dorsky, who happened to be sitting behind me, gasp in alarm. The markings on the surface of the paper, like the melting film, seem to break from representation into abstraction, suspended between stills.

 Some works ask us to consider attention itself. The ground we walk on, every step, the trees we walk past every day. How can we be more considerate of our surroundings? What might we want to see change in the world? In what ways are we connected to the rest of the world whether we like it or not? What is the now and how to live in it?

 With only the instructions, “to play for the trees outside the window of the gallery,” I asked the gallery director and flute player, Photi, to make a recording of the song “Nature Boy,” written by Eden Ahbez and made famous by Nat King Cole. I had the recording slowed to a speed that the tree might perceive.

 In his book The Forest Unseen, David George Haskell chooses a square meter to sit with for a year. I sat with a square foot of ground in Ukiah, California. In a drawing of the ground, what is the figure? Every leaf, every twig entered this picture from someplace else and reflects its surrounding in a complex web of space and time. Though based on months of close observation, my drawing ended up being mostly fantasy. Yet it very naturalistically captures the ways in which that small plot of land exceeded my capacities of perception and comprehension.

 Sometimes I do a similar thing with paper, gathering in and magnifying my perceptions of minute variations in the weave of pulp that forms the surface. My intuition and an immediate response to the physicality of the paper dictate the marks. This could be a way of being in the world, or being of it.

 Special thanks to the two Japanese Pagoda trees, Matteah Baim for sound engineering, and Photi Giovanis for his woodwind contributions.

<![CDATA[
The Lost Sea is the largest underground lake in the U.S. It is located in a complex system of caves named Craighead Caverns at the foothills of the Smoky Mountains. Over time, the small cave entrance to the lake was hidden due to rising water, and later it was re-discovered by different people with various motives. Their histories and intentions are little known and largely whitewashed. What is known is that certain chambers were used by generations of Native people. White settlers began using the temperate caves for food storage around 1820. Confederate soldiers mined the caves for saltpeter which was used for ammunition, and they left their grafiti charred into the ceiling. In 1915, a dancehall floor was installed in a large chamber, positioned alongside cockfights and gambling. Bootleggers operated stills of moonshine. In 1927, electric lights were established to showcase the prowess of the new Tennessee Power Co. By 1965, the Lost Sea was opened as a tourist attraction by a group of stockholders. The visible area of the lake is 4.5 acres but the depths of the body of water are still unknown. Given the past exploitative activity and shady claims of ownership, It is not difficult to imagine what other behavior might have occurred within these clandestine walls where evidence could have been easily hidden in the sunless sea.

 The Lost Sea is the title of a new body of work by Corinne Jones. The title references the underground lake as an allegorical repository of hidden histories with which our country has yet to reckon. The artist seeks to connect the past and present by making a physical space to communicate untold, lesser known or marginalized stories. Islands of the Lost Sea, 2018, are sculptural works made of stacks of moving blankets on top of ‘floor paintings’. The stacked blankets are an invitation to the viewer to have a seat, to gather in an area designated for discussion. Within the Chamber of the Lost Sea, the Islands are flanked by two large paintings from a continuing series, Counterpart Sevens 5 (A+B), 2018. The paintings are equiluminant color fields on seven-sided canvases that ‘mirror’ each other. A site-specific work, Double Trap, Single Use, 2018, is made from transparent sheets of colored plastic adhered to both sides of the gallery window. The rippled lines of the window piece parallel the lines in the ‘floor paintings’ and moving blankets.

MARC STRAUS presents its fourth solo exhibition of new paintings by Antonio Santín.

 Antonio Santín is well known for his adroit rendering of elegant Persian rugs that encapsulate technical precision and innovative compositions. Alluding to concealed anthropomorphic forms, their sculptural qualities make one question whether his fabricated reality is more real than your own. Much like the Gobelins Manufactory was to luxurious Renaissance tapestries, Santín’s approach to his signature trompe l’oeil paintings focus on arresting intricate details and surface textures.

 Santín’s new work arrives with bold punches of color that further dissolves figurative allusions in his work. One could read these new works as modern rugs or fully non-objective abstract compositions using only hues and geometries similar to abstract painters of the post-war period. In Apaña (2018), a unique fusion of Josef Albers sharp and boldly colored squares with the fuzzy, blurred palette of Mark Rothko, Santín subverts the experience of flat color field paintings by ‘crumpling’ the very view.

 Santín’s arresting and highly tactile works with its uncannily realistic application of shadow and highlight tempt the viewer to reach out and run their hand over the rug’s pile, which is after all a two-dimensional painting on the canvas mounted on the wall.

 Antonio Santín, born in Madrid, Spain in 1978, works and resides in Brooklyn, New York. He received his Degree in Fine Arts from Universidad Complutense de Madrid in 2005. His work has been exhibited in international museums, including Knoxville Museum of Art, TN, US, and is represented in collections of Centre National de Arts Plastiques, Paris, and in private collections worldwide. His public installations include a permanent sculpture commissioned by the city of Madrid in 2003. In 2016, his works were shown at the Sharjah Art Museum for the of the nineteenth edition of the Islamic Art Festival. In 2017-2018 his work was included in “Between I &amp; Thou” at Hudson Valley Museum of Contemporary Art, Peekskill, NY.

<![CDATA[
MARC STRAUS presents its fourth solo exhibition of Korean artist Jong Oh set in the new third and fourth floor gallery spaces.

 Oh’s work challenges an architecture that is not meant to impose or overbear on what it houses. Taking neutral, white gallery walls and seemingly open spaces, Oh marks boundaries, molds air and generates a presence from what is initially perceived as sheer absence. These dramatic spatial gestures toy with perception to create a physical experience extending beyond the visual. Point extends to line, and line connects to line eventually creating an ephemeral shape, one that could have existed in space but required the work of the artist to truly take visible form.

 In practice, Oh’s process is responsive and flexible, working as a conversation between artist and architecture, but the end result is commanding, and compelling. Unlike traditional building materials used to demarcate and maintain spatial boundaries, Oh’s sculptures activate humble means, though with much of the same result. String, plexiglass, nails, stones, and more unite to direct attention in their placement and render the invisible, visible. Thus, his ability to shape space is at moments subtle and ephemeral, but entirely decisive.

 Fourth Floor Gallery Space
 For his fourth solo show at MARC STRAUS, Jong Oh enters into dialogue with the newly completed third and fourth floor gallery spaces, a first in the history of the gallery. Responding to these two very different architectural arenas, Oh’s work traces the familiar imperceptibility of built environments, calling into question the normalized spatial definitions of wall, room, window, skylight, and door. These processes defamiliarize the simple architecture of the gallery wall by marking unseen physical boundaries and interjecting into spaces that feel open. As Oh’s sculptures move into the interstices, further fragmenting, dividing, and constructing the notion of space, viewers not only have a chance to visualize the completed galleries themselves, but a chance to feel them, in all of their nuanced forms, through the perception-altering processes of Jong Oh.

 Currently living and working in New York, Jong Oh was born in Mauritania in 1981, and earned his BFA from Hongik University in Seoul and MFA from the School of Visual Art in New York. Since then, Oh has participated in numerous solo and group shows worldwide, including Corner Dialogue at the Seoul Museum of Art’s Project gallery and Depot at Galerie Jochen Hempel. Presently, Oh is featured in EVERY DAY IS A GOOD DAY (日々是好日) Tokyo, Japan, a performance-based exhibition presented by Spiral and Marc Straus with artist Jinsu Han. He is also presently in a two-artist exhibition at the DeCordova Museum in Massachusetts entitled Sculpting with Air.

Freight + Volume presents Unstung, an exhibition of new paintings by Samuel Jablon. This show marks the artist’s third solo exhibition with the gallery, as well as a shift from the glass, mirror, and tile ornamentation that characterized his earlier work to a focus on paint itself as a material.

 As if they were fragments of a lost text, the paintings of Unstung act as a single poem whose careening elements create an engagingly paradoxical climate. In all of these works a sense of foreboding and destruction is balanced, equally, with an optimistic resolve. Jablon’s colors work to anchor his written elements—an amalgam of advertising slogans, fragments from overheard conversations, and phrases that linger in the artist’s mind. Ranging from public to personal and conversational in tone, the snatches of text juxtapose individuality and inner thought with group language, creating an impression that is both enigmatic and utterly descriptive of contemporary life.

 A sense of almost whimsical optimism underscores the work, demonstrated in the paintings Death is Elsewhere, Eat Disasters, and Oaths Against Dying. Seeming to suggest that one can alter one’s circumstances (or at least one’s experience of them) through language and expression, these works propose a way of coping with an increasingly disturbing age and asserting one’s own autonomy. The notion of creative expression reverberates throughout Unstung, with the interlocking relationship between the text and Jablon’s rendering of it in paint forming a central node. When presented with text and an accompanying image, the viewer will inevitably draw connections. Describing his compositions as “anarchic networks of multi-hued brushstrokes”, Jablon invites these associations, though they remain elusive and seldom resolve into clear conclusions.
 Rather than constructing binary relationships between visual and linguistic elements, Jablon synthesizes the two into a sort of hybrid voice. Words slip into a nether-space between letters and pure form, and the texture of each painting is infused with a euphoric and frenzied energy. Surfaces are built up with layers of oil and acrylic that sweep, stall, fall, and collide. Words are layered, written backwards, or broken apart. Every work obscures language to some degree, so that the content of a painting must be gradually deciphered rather than instantaneously read, questioning whether the viewer is reading an image or looking at language. Though traces of a common thread appear, such as the geometric shapes that take on almost alchemical import in Trouble, Unstung, and Unslept, Unsleeping Elsewhere, Jablon’s work defies structure, instead functioning at the junctions of deconstructed form and language.

 Samuel Jablon is an artist and poet who explores the discursivity and visuality of art and poetry, as well as the interconnection and possibilities of these two forms. He has been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, The Queens Museum, Hauser &amp; Wirth, Storefront for Art and Architecture, The Kitchen, Artists Space, with solo exhibitions at Freight + Volume, Arts + Leisure, and Diane Rosenstein. His work has been reviewed in The Wall Street Journal, Art in America, ARTnews, The Brooklyn Rail, BOMB, Interview Magazine, and others.

Ulterior Gallery presents its third year with Takashi Kunitani’s second solo exhibition with the gallery, Spaceless Space.

 Kunitani’s ongoing series of installations are comprised of multiple neon tubes that the artist deforms with his own breath. Through this breathing process, Kunitani expands the internal volume of the glass tube, blurring the boundary between the inside and outside of the sculpture. In these installations, viewers see the chemical elements neon and argon captured within the multilateral, transparent surface of the sculpture. This ephemerality of the object itself, combined with the expansive visual nature of blown glass and radiant neon tubes, translates the space where Kunitani’s neon is enacted into an expanded volume without clear boundaries between object, space, and viewer.

 For this exhibition at Ulterior, Kunitani will realize a full-room installation of red (neon) and blue (argon) tubes. The artist states: “The placement of these two different colors reflects my idea of a board game, as if we were in the game without knowing the rules or how each piece should be placed… We just need to judge where to be, how to see, from the given circumstances, as the ephemeral viewing experience is unique to the individual.” These neon works form an expansive apparatus designed to activate the tension between viewer and artwork. Decisions made by visitors as they move through the space individualize the viewing experience, making each moment unique.

 In the years since he began working on it in 2001, Kunitani’s series of sculpture installations, Spaceless Space, has become his signature work. While room-sized installations of works from this series have been shown at museums in Kyoto, Hyogo, and Osaka, and in other galleries and non-profit spaces in Japan, the exhibition at Ulterior represents the first full-scale exhibition of these works that the artist has exhibited outside of Japan.

 Takashi Kunitani was born in Kyoto, Japan in 1974 and graduated from Seian University of Art and Design in Shiga Prefecture, Japan in 1997, where he studied under Norio Imai, one of the prominent Gutai artists. Kunitani’s works have been the subject of numerous solo and group exhibitions, including: Something Red, Kyoto Art Center, Kyoto, Japan (solo, 2018); Takashi Kunitani: Deep Projection, Hyogo Prefectural Museum of Art, Hyogo, Japan (solo, 2015); Two Passages, Nuit Blanche Kyoto 2012, Kyoto Art Center, Kyoto, Japan (2012); Today’s Artist 48: Takashi Kunitani—The Vertical Horizon, Osaka Contemporary Art Center, Osaka, Japan (solo, 2007); Criterium 54: Takashi Kunitani, Art Tower Mito, Ibaraki, Japan (solo, 2003). He lives and works in Kyoto.

<![CDATA[
Hannes Schmid’s work as a professional photographer is well known. His career began in the 1960s with photo essays documenting travels in Africa and Asia. In the 1970s and early 1980s Schmid emerged as one of the world’s most widely reproduced rock and roll photographers, turning out iconic images of the best known stars of the day. His photographs of Roxy Music, Van Halen, Motorhead, AC/DC, Kraftwork, Kiss, ABBA, The Who, Paul McCartney, The Police, Blondie, et al. are instantly recognizable.

 After an award-winnng decade working in fashion photography, shooting first for German Vogue, Armani, Kenzo and Benneton, Schmid was hired by the Leo Burnett advertising agency to reimagine the Marlboro Man. Thus Schmid, who is Swiss, took a place alongside a small number other photographers – Sam Abell, Jim Krantz – in defining an American icon. In addition to their use in magazine and billboard advertizing, Schmid’s photographs for Marlboro have been appropriated by Richard Prince, most notably in Prince’s exhibition at the 2003 Venice Biennale.

 In the 2003 Schmid began to paint meticulous photorealistic reinterpretations of his Marlboro photography as a means of reclaiming his commerical work in service to his own artistic vison, not to mention as a way to sidestep the constraints copyright law placed on his use of his own work. Reflexive as these issues tend to be, Schmid was forced to deal with questions similar to those that Prince confronts in his appropriation of commercial imagery by artists such as Schmid. Given the difficulties of a Swiss citizen mounting legal challenges in the United States, Schmid sidesteped actions to curtail Prince’s use of his images and self-appropriated them for his painitngs.

 Curated by Andrew Kachel and Clara López Menéndez


 As an activity that is perhaps as widely shared as it is varied in character, what potentials are latent in work as a ground for reconsidering entrenched social, political, and economic relations?

 A new job to unwork at is a multidisciplinary project that studies the many social, material, and economic processes that we understand as “work,” and the ways in which this classification of activity operates as a legitimating discourse that privileges certain subjects and life choices. We draw on the concept of unwork (coined by Valerie Solanas in SCUM Manifesto) as a wry subversion of work, focusing on practices that re-imagine work’s intended flows and ends, often short-circuiting the power relations inherent in labor relations, distilling their often destructive potentials into a politics of commoning and care. The project is the continuation of ongoing research that examines the ideological consequences of work in shaping our identities and experiences of the world. The latest materialization of this research takes the shape of a series of public programs beginning in August and an exhibition opening on September 9.

 All events are free and open to the public unless otherwise noted.


 PUBLIC PROGRAMS:

 Aug 23
 Punching Songs Together

 this collective musical experiment wants to hold a joyous space for lyrical loudness.
 join us for a celebration of unknown melodic outcomes, hesitant vibrations and rhythmical fears.

 Suggested donation. No one turned away for lack of funds.



 Aug 26
 Coop Fund
 2-5pm

 Coop Fund members will host two workshops that give a basic introduction to Coop Fund, detailing how it was started, and how it operates now. Refreshments will be provided.

 All are welcome to attend. If possible, please RSVP in advance to: coopfundcooperative@gmail.com.



 Aug 29
 JoAnn Elam, Everyday People (Rough Cut), 1978-90, 22 min
 Kevin Jerome Everson, Company Line, 2009, 30 min
 Curated by Karl McCool
 7-9pm

 A screening of two films, which explore the connections between everyday life, work, and community. With her work-in-progress, Everyday People, left unfinished at her death, JoAnn Elam documents her experiences as a postal worker, as well as those of her coworkers, proposing an “avant-garde film with a working class … ideology.” In Company Line, Kevin Jerome Everson similarly combines documentary and experimental film practices, as city employees and former residents narrate accounts of the “Company Line,” one of the first predominately Black neighborhoods in Mansfield, Ohio, located close to an old steel mill.



 Aug 31
 Kathi Weeks and Lise Soskolne (W.A.G.E.)
 7-9pm

 A conversation between Kathi Weeks, Professor of Gender, Sexuality and Feminist Studies at Duke University and author of The Problem with Work: Feminism, Marxism, Antiwork Politics and Postwork Imaginaries, and Lise Soskolne, artist and core organizer of Working Artists and the Greater Economy (W.A.G.E.), a New York-based activist organization.

anism as well as the profound impact of the Korean War and subsequent partition of North and South. On view 13 September – 13 October 2018, the exhibition includes two video works and a series of photographs by the Seoul-based artist. This is Park’s second solo show in New York; his first exhibition at the gallery was in 2016.

 Situated in the front gallery is Child Soldier (2017 – 2018), a series of photographs and film stills that depict North Korean soldiers doing everyday activities. While seemingly innocuous, Park’s images suggest that young soldiers in the North Korean People’s Army may not be as ideologically rigid as portrayed. Instead Park depicts the young men as ordinary, lazy and innocent, wandering in the forest, reading and listening to music. This reimagination of daily life forces the viewer to move beyond propagandistic depictions and confront the stark ideologies that govern contemporary Korean society. Child Soldier begs the question: Is there an image of North Korea that is free of ideology, politics, or war?

 Gallery two features the critically acclaimed video Citizen’s Forest (2016), a three-channel installation that serves as an allegory of modern-day Korea. Evoking literary genres ranging from Asian gothic to heavy metal, the video chronicles major tragedies in the nation’s past such as the Donghak Peasant Revolution (1894), the Korean War (1950 – 1953), the Gwangju Uprising (1980) and the recent Sewol Ferry Disaster (2014). The work’s panoramic structure evokes traditional “shan-su” (landscape) scroll paintings. This narrative format was inspired by two historical works by beloved Korean artists: Oh Yoon’s incomplete work The Lemures chronicles the many forgotten victims in Korean history and the poem by Kim Soo-young, Colossal Roots. In Citizen’s Forest, viewers are invited to accompany this ragtag group as they walk slowly through the forest; mixing history and fiction, the actors play musical instruments and impersonate the dead as they mourn the loss of their fellow citizens.

 The final work in the show is a newly commissioned video titled BELIEVE IT OR NOT (2018). Created by Park Chan-Kyong and his brother Park Chan-Wook under the moniker PARKing CHANce, BELIEVE IT OR NOT is a scripted narrative that tells a gripping story of State sponsored spying and deception through the eyes of defectors and those who help them escape. Confronting directly the disinformation that exists in both North and South Korea, the video is inspired by real individuals who have crossed the cultural and military borders that separate the two nations. Taking cues from people who have chosen to publicly denounce their country of origin, resettle and then sometimes return home again, Park tells a story where defectors may in fact be acting as spies and double agents and it is never clear what one’s motives really are. In so doing, Park forces the audience to question the integrity and motivations of both North and South Korea, relaying the stark human cost of Cold War politics and propaganda, and confronting the fear and paranoia that still underlies the Korean peninsula.

 Park Chan-Kyong (b. 1965) is a media artist, film director and writer. He graduated from Seoul National University in 1988 with a BFA in Painting, and the California Institute of the Arts with a MFA in Photography in 1995. Park served as the Artistic Director of the SeMA Biennale Mediacity Seoul in 2014. His major works include Manshin: Ten Thousand Spirits (2013), Night Fishing (2011, co-directed by Park Chan-wook), Sindoan (2008), Power Passage (2004) and Sets (2000).

 Park’s work has exhibited internationally in numerous solo and group exhibitions including Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlin (2017), Taipei Biennial (2016), Anyang Public Art Project (2016), Iniva, London (2015), Art Sonje Center, Seoul (2013), and Atelier Hermès, Seoul (2008, 2012). Park was awarded the Hermès Korea Art Award in 2004, and the Golden Bear for best short film at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2011 for Night Fishing.

 His works are included in the collection of major art institutions including the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, Korea; KADIST, Paris and San Francisco; Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes, Nantes; Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art, Seoul; Seoul Museum of Art; Gyeonggi Museum of Modern Art, Ansan; and Art Sonje Center, Seoul.

tions, the discrete works in this show assert a space for desire and belonging in the face of a racist imaginary that relies on difference and subjection. The title of the show takes its inspiration from queer literary theorist Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick and her book Touching Feeling, which conceptualizes beside as a non-binaristic, non-dualistic spacialization, allowing for a non-linear logic that opens up possibilities to imagine identity as a multiplicity of “desiring, identifying, representing, repelling, differentiating, mimicking…” We Are Beside Ourselves is the first installment of a larger project that attempts to respond to our current political crisis vis a vis the delirious promise and desire of radical politics.

 Mining archives of what seems to be the familiar history of the 1960s and 1970s radical liberation movements, these photo-based works, including carbon transfer photographs on mirror and lithographic prints, begin to make legible a political genealogy that draws out the intertwined and parallel relationships between the individual and the collective, the personal and the political. The works in We Are Beside Ourselves forges a material history for Asian American resistance, a history that frames the visualization of political identities in photographic terms of the legible. It asks: What is unseen? What has been refused to be acknowledged? Ultimately, the installation of works suggests the powerful intimacies in political positions and attempts to “cultivate the epistemological and historical archive of solidarity.”

 Hồng-Ân Trương (1976) uses photography, video, sound, and sculpture to examine histories of war as well as immigrant, refugee, and decolonial narratives. Her work engages with the concept that politics is the struggle for equal recognition within society, with aesthetics at the core of this battle. Starting with the premise that memory is political, her projects examine structures of time, memory, and the production of knowledge by engaging with archival materials, individual and collective narratives, and histories that span cultural and national borders.

 Her work has been shown at the International Center for Photography, NY; Art in General, NY; Smack Mellon, NY; the Nasher Museum of Art, Durham, NC; and The Kitchen, NY, among others. In 2013 she was recipient of an Art Matters Grant, a Franconia Sculpture Park Jerome Fellowship, and a Socrates Sculpture Park Emerging Artist Fellowship. She was an artist-in-residence at the Irish Museum of Modern Art in 2015 and at Marble House Project in 2017. Recent exhibitions include a two-person show at Nhà Sàn in Hanoi, Vietnam and the Irish Museum of Art in 2016; and two group shows at The Drawing Center in NY as part of the Open Session Program in 2017. In 2017 she was awarded a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Emergency Grant for a solo show at Lump Gallery in Raleigh, NC. She was included in the most recent iteration of Prospect New Orleans, P4: The Lotus in Spite of the Swamp. Her work is included in Being: New Photography 2018, the latest edition of MoMA’s New Photography series.

 She received her MFA from the University of California, Irvine, and was a studio art fellow in the Whitney Independent Study Program in 2008-2009. She is an Associate Professor of Art and Director of Graduate Studies in the MFA Program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

<![CDATA[
For his second exhibition at the Feldman Gallery, artist Fredric Riskin reflects on the mystery, unseen political nuances and dark pain of the 9/11 attack as it remains an unhealed wound in the American psyche.

 The artist’s immersive installation explores that trauma; it examines our individual, collective, and government’s ongoing response to this catastrophe. It is the subsequent debasement of American values that gives the exhibition its title: “9/11 The Collapse of Conscience.” Both somber and dramatic, the installation presents powerful iconic imagery in different media - print, canvas, video and sound.

 Riskin’s modus operandi is a unique compendium of in-depth analysis and high-tech expertise. His first one-person exhibition at the gallery in 1987, “Sub Rosa: A Psychic Journey,” examined the wilderness of mirrors between public perception of an international event and highly classified counterintelligence strategies.

 The exhibition was extensively reviewed in the art and popular press, including New York Magazine, ARTnews, Artforum, The Village Voice, Washington Times, and National Public Radio. The artist currently lives in Los Angeles.

 “Riskin’s recent installation of Conceptual art, Sub Rosa: A Psychic Journey, 1987, created … a modern fable of unseen powers, vague and superhuman … Although the validity of Riskin’s correspondences (whether actual or metaphorical) mount the realms of psychic perception, supersonic travel, satellite networks, and surveillance is arguable, his evocation of the collapse of space/time limits through advanced technology is remarkably interesting.”

 - Carlo McCormic Artforum 1987

 “Photo-conceptual story art, photo-narrative art form. Subject of first show narrated by a psychic who worked for the CIA, links the taking of hostages at a top secret US surveillance base in Iran with the pyramid of Cheops, alignments of spy planes and satellites and the downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007. By the time you read the second panel, you’re hooked.”

 - Kim Levin Village Voice 1987

For over forty years, David Ligare has been making paintings that conceptually link ancient Greek philosophy to contemporary social needs. Through established painting tropes like the figure and the landscape, Ligare has been embedding tenets of Plato and Aristotle within deftly painted scenes allegorizing social issues such as literacy and homelessness. With Still Life, the artist continues his thesis by giving new meaning and a new history to that eponymous genre. Hirschl &amp; Adler Modern is honored to present these 20 recent paintings by David Ligare, in his third solo exhibition with the gallery.

 David Ligare (born 1945, Oak Park, IL) studied at the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, CA. He has shown his paintings in many solo exhibitions in New York, Los Angeles, London, Rome, San Francisco, Seattle and elsewhere. His work can be found in numerous permanent collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco; the Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, CT; the Frye Art Museum, Seattle; and the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, Italy. The artist’s recent retrospective, David Ligare: California Classicist, traveled from the Crocker Art Museum, Sacramento, CA to the Laguna Art Museum, Laguna, CA; Georgia Art Museum, Athens, GA; and Triton Museum of Art, Santa Clara, CA. This exhibition was accompanied by a major monograph on the artist. Ligare lives and works in the Carmel Valley, CA.

Gagosian presents I’ve Seen Gray Whales Go By, new paintings by Mary Weatherford. This is her first solo exhibition with the gallery.

 Weatherford makes large paintings comprising grounds of spontaneously sponged paint on heavy linen canvases surmounted by one or more carefully shaped and placed colored neon tubes. The canvas—prepared with white gesso mixed with marble dust, and worked on with Flashe paint, a highly pigmented but readily diluted emulsion—supports startlingly diverse applications of color. The surface of the paint ranges from matte and velvety to transparent and translucent. The canvas is at times densely filled, reading as a painterly continuum; at others, it shifts in color from edge to edge of the painting; and at yet others it contains clusters of marks set in relatively bare surroundings. And the color itself varies significantly: blurred blues, muted yellows, and carnival reds; mineral hues, evoking slate or steel; pinks suggestive of fruit or flesh; and many different blacks, recalling shiny feathers.

 The neon tubes attached to these fields of color advance a unique practice that Weatherford began in 2012, inspired by illuminated signs along the streets of old Bakersfield, California. In her use of neon, she transformed what had previously been used for advertising—and had been appropriated as such by earlier artists—into a radically new form of pictorial drawing. Casting an industrial light onto the fields of color, the neon tubes read as hand-drawn lines across the surface, although they are sometimes so bright that they are blinding to look at, creating afterimages. Weatherford has used one or as many as five individual tubes, often bent away from the surface, and on occasion extending beyond the edges of the canvas. The cords for the neon fixtures make their own layer of drawing on top of the painting, and lead down to large magnetic transformers sitting like anchors on the floor.

<![CDATA[
Aliens and poodles populate the neon landscape of Margot Bird’s first New York solo exhibition “Poodle Saga”, sometimes tied together by chunky gold chains, sometimes floating on animal pattern backgrounds. Bird presents a new planet, where the aliens have enticed, or perhaps entrapped, the poodles into a lively exchange. Bird does not impose a narrative on her characters: aliens ride poodles like circus showgirls and poodles sprout butterfly wings or long snake-like necks in the candy-colored fluorescent world. Bird’s narrative looseness is echoed in her execution— the paintings are rich with color and free-flowing brushstrokes. We are able to catch glimpses of how this other world might have emerged, but there are no specifics.

 In addition to paintings are ceramic sculptures of gilded poodles, both glamorous and kitsch, recalling both a grandmother’s prized porcelain collection and a pop diva’s wildly lavish jewels. Her treatment of aliens, a potentially terrifying subject when one considers the possibilities, turns to the accepted anthropomorphized version of “little green men,” often sporting bling of their own. This melding of worlds is intentional: Bird is drawn to the vivid impression these trappings create. Just as the poodles’ silly traditional haircut transforms them into a snobby “high class” animal from an ordinary dog, the gold chains and rings people wear transform them from ordinary people into larger-than-life personalities. Bird’s works embrace the ridiculous and indulge our desire to make the average spectacular and the unknown loveably familiar.

 Margot Bird (b. 1982, Sioux City, Iowa) lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. She received her Bachelor of Arts degree from University of Wisconsin- Madison, WI in 2006. She has exhibited at Yo Mama Gallery, Brooklyn, NY and created murals in Oaxaca, Mexico City, Seattle and New York City. This will be Bird’s first exhibition with the gallery.

<![CDATA[
Nailya Alexander Gallery presents George Tice’s third solo exhibition. Our exhibition commemorates the artist’s life and his six decades of contributions to the fields of fine art photography, printmaking, and American history.

 Born on October 13, 1938 in Newark, New Jersey, George Tice was inspired as a young boy by his father’s photo albums to purchase a $29.95 Kodak Pony camera and begin taking photographs. At age fourteen, he became the youngest member of the Carteret Camera Club, and a few years later enlisted in the U.S. Navy as a photographer’s mate. In 1959, the twenty-year-old Tice photographed an explosion aboard the USS Wasp. The photograph made the front page of The New York Times and caught the attention of Edward Steichen, then Director of the Department of Photography at the Museum of Modern Art, who acquired the photograph for the museum’s collection.

 Tice, whose eye has been drawn to factory facades, junked cars, and eerily lit gas stations, has long explored his affinity for the mid-century generation of American social and landscape photographers that includes such luminaries as Walker Evans. Tice’s photographs, however, carve out their own space in photographic history as methodical and deeply felt meditations on place and memory, particularly with respect to the unpolished and oft-forgotten pockets of small-town America. In a 2000 review for The New York Times, critic Margarett Loke wrote, “For Mr. Tice, time has a way of standing still. He finds quiet, enduring beauty in such places as the interior of a Shaker building in Maine; in a ghostly ribbon of a road in Lancaster, PA, and in a tree trunk in Paterson that bears the hieroglyphics of time.”

 In his photographs of Paterson, New Jersey, Tice collects palpable evidence of America’s crumbling industrial past with artistry and grace. Once a 19th-century manufacturing hub, Paterson is now a city of classic American diners, empty mills, and outlet stores. Part artist, part historian, Tice collects and commemorates the city’s history with each photograph, and in the process assembles a greater history of the country’s ever-changing social, economic, and architectural landscape. Reflecting upon Paterson in a 2002 interview with The New York Times, Tice observed, “A place belongs to those who claim it.”

 Each of these neglected locales is transformed by Tice’s lens and craft into a masterful print. Profoundly moved by a platinum print of Frederick Evans’s Lincoln Cathedral: From the Castle (1898), Tice has devoted himself equally to the taking of photographs and to the craft of printing and has acquired a reputation as one of the most skillful darkroom printers of his generation. The uniquely desolate and painterly light of a George Tice print produces a mood not dissimilar to that found in an Edward Hopper painting. Tice served as Edward Steichen’s last printer and was entrusted to create limited-edition portfolios of photographs by Frederick Evans, Francis Bruguière, and Edward Weston.

 George Tice’s photographs can be found in over 125 museum collections around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the J. Paul Getty Foundation. He has received numerous fellowships and commissions, including from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Guggenheim Foundation, as well as The Bradford Fellowship (U.K.).

“Before my eyes were both young bodies and old physiques, some starkly naked, others seductively sheathed. They presented the artifice of feigned desire in vintage photographs from one hundred and twenty-five years ago. Some displayed the fresh faces of innocence while others the weary lined facades of bitter experience. These images were compelling individually but as a whole, they captured an unseen world of negotiated passion in American life, written about extensively but rarely, for good reason, documented visually. Multiple feelings of curiosity and excitement came over me after finally realizing the potential importance of these photographs. There was also a recognition that their acquisition carried responsibility to find out the story, which lay hidden behind those faces and figures from another era.” -Robert Flynn Johnson

 “If a stranger arrived in almost any American city during the 1890s, he would have easily found a red-light district, tolerated by the police in exchange for graft, and accepted by the community because it hid and contained prostitution in a segregated neighborhood. The oldest profession was neither legal nor illegal; it was simply tolerated as a ‘Necessary Evil,’ as an effort to protect ‘innocent’ women and girls from rapacious men.

 That would soon change, but during much of the nineteenth century, Americans viewed prostitution as a safety valve for sexually active men who might attack respectable young women or for wandering husbands who strayed from their uninterested wives” –Ruth Rosen

 “Known as ‘unmentionables,’ undergarments were only seen in rare glimpses in daily life—a briefly lifted skirt of a woman crossing a muddy street exposed the lace ruffle of a petticoat. Worn by the prostitutes that William Goldman photographed, lingerie gives the erotic association with the nude body, but, with part of the picture unseen, the mind fills in using the power of the imagination. The undergarments would have provided the titillation of layers of fabric unraveling and protracted flirtation.” -Dennita Sewell

 “For these working girls who were already going against the drudgery of toiling in a factory or as a domestic, who were surviving in a patriarchal world by their wits and sexuality, the opportunity to sit for Mr. Goldman was very likely not only thrilling—it was also empowering” -Dita Von Teese

 “What we can surmise from his photographs is that Goldman was a truly sensitive human being both artistically and emotionally. The women seem playful in some images while moody and withdrawn in others, especially when they hide their identity with masks, fans, or hands. The manner in which Goldman posed these women, however, is never crude or unfeeling. He had a way of allowing the women to appear natural in the presence of his camera. The women display a willing collaboration with him in the creation of these captivating images.” -Robert Flynn Johnson

Half Gallery presents Flat Earth, Geneive Figgis’ second solo exhibition at the gallery. Figgis synthesizes historical paintings, interior distortions and mythological planes to highlight her unique tincture of romance and melancholy.

 In Neptune and Amphitrite, the artist takes David Teniers The Younger’s composition and transforms it into what could only be a Figgis design incorporating a bright color palette, swirled skies and watchful expressions. In Sisters, the artist leaves the viewer inside one of her dreamy residences, complete with vague familial portraits, an elaborate chandelier and two decorated women who no doubt have a secret between them.

 In Artforum, Riccardo Venturi writes of Figgis’ figures from her exhibition at Almine Rech in Paris:

 Genieve Figgis’ painted tableaux often seem to present a dramatic event, like an operatic performance, but one whose coordinates can’t fully be discerned. The Irish painter’s characters, who adopt theatrical poses or stand in groups, as in a conversation piece, are well aware that they are on public display.

 Genieve Figgis’ first solo exhibition at Half Gallery, Good Morning, Midnight was in 2014. Currently, Figgis is exhibiting work in L’Alamanch at Le Consortium in Dijon through October 14th, 2018.

With the beginning of the Fall 2018 exhibition season, Pace Prints will be celebrating its 50th anniversary as a gallery and publisher of fine art prints and multiples.

 Since 1968, Pace Prints has embraced a philosophy of providing artists with printmaking facilities in a wide variety of media, from etching to handmade paper and beyond, to enable them to pursue their creativity as printmakers. During this period, Pace Prints has collaborated with over 150 artists internationally.

 To celebrate this 50th anniversary, Pace Prints will initiate the fall season with two exhibitions at 32 East 57th Street and 521 West 26th Street of editions that were created by artists who began their association with Pace Prints in the first decade of its publishing activities.
 At Pace Prints, 32 East 57th Street:

 Welcome Back is an exhibition of nine initial Pace Prints projects — including our inaugural publication, Lucas Samaras’s Book, 1968 — and editions by Gene Davis, Robert Goodnough, Charles Hinman, Nicholas Krushenick, Sven Lukin , Kenzo Okada, Ernest Trova, and Jack Youngerman. The exhibition will open on September 12th and continue through October 13th.

Silas Von Morisse Gallery presents MONIKA WEISS KOIMAN II- Years Without Summers (24 Nocturnes), the first solo exhibition at the gallery of celebrated Polish artist MONIKA WEISS.

 Monika Weiss’ Koiman II – Years Without Summers (24 Nocturnes) is a single-channel, digital 4K film projection with sound, comprising 24 short films and sound compositions, and a series of related charcoal and graphite drawings. This work—inspired by Winterreise (Winter Journey), a cycle of 24 songs for voice and piano composed in 1828 by Franz Schubert— is dedicated to the artist’s late mother, pianist Gabriela Weiss, and to current refugees and migrants around the world.

 In 1815, the eruption of the Mt. Tambora volcano in Indonesia caused a globally migrating ash cloud, resulting in dramatic cooling in Europe and the northern United States. The unusually cold and dark summer of 1816, often referred to as the “year without summer” was characterized by persistent rain, snow and frost, which triggered agricultural disaster, famine and migration and potentially inspired a number of works by artists, composers and writers at the time, including Winterreise. The accounts by travellers at sea following the explosion describe dark days where it was impossible “to see your hand outstretched.” Weiss chose the musical and painterly form of the nocturne as a metaphor for the darkness of the year without summer and the current time in which our culture and civilization today truly cannot see its own future beyond “the hand outstretched.”

 “Two hundred years later, the world appears to me as if shrouded in a symbolic ash cloud resulting from global climate change, the current refugee crisis and the gradual global move towards fascist ideologies,” says the artist. “Koiman II is meant to evoke this notion of darkness, coldness and clouding, yet it also offers filmic and sonic poetry and beauty, as a form of hope and a place of refuge.”

 Koiman II presents Weiss’ vision of our current period of “dark summers” through her film, drawing and musical composition and performance. Her’ silent films depict gradually unfolding scenes shot from a stationary camera, suggesting a contemplative viewing akin to painting or drawing. Each of the 24 “still-films” shows an anonymous female protagonist (performed by the artist in wintery landscapes) wearing a veil and long black dress; the silent, slow gestures evoke a mournful lamentation. The scenes are choreographed, filmed and edited by the artist, who uses superimposition and reversed sequences to create a sense of suspended time, with no clear beginning or end. Weiss wrote vocal and instrumental music for each of the films and worked with opera vocalists to perform her compositions. She edited and recomposed the recordings into unique, polyphonic environments for each film. All of the drawings in the exhibition appear as superimposed images in the films while existing as individual, stand-alone works.

 “The whole of this work is dedicated to my late mother, pianist Gabriela Weiss who died in April 2017, and to all currently displaced refuges and migrants trying to find shelter. As a child I listened daily to my mother practicing Chopin’s Nocturnes. Forever scarred by World War II, my mother barely escaped a hunt systematically exercised by both Soviet and German occupants in Poland, surviving as a refugee in her mother’s arms.” (Monika Weiss)

 To date this project has received generous support from Harvestworks Digital Media Arts Center, New York City, BRIC Arts Media, Brooklyn, NY, and Yaddo Artists’ Colony, Saratoga Springs, NY.

Project:ARTspace presents New York artist Kevin Sudeith in Knight Errant, his second solo exhibition with the gallery. Sudeith is showcasing videos and large-scale impressions made from an expedition to Iceland earlier this year.

 For the past ten years, Sudeith has led a wandering life. He travels in a white van visiting rural communities and creating immovable carvings. His subjects are always life like, iconic imagery of local cultures and environments. This has been done in pursuit of bringing art to communities that seem so far from it and at the same time, Sudeith is questing for champions of his art. The nature of traveling and making immovable works has made Sudeith’s pieces take on qualities that are charitable, social, and timeless.

 For Knight Errant three large impressions of his Icelandic horsemen are the highlight. The impressions taken from the carving are heavily embossed on handmade paper. They capture the image and sculptural depth of the carving in minute detail. These are the largest pieces made by Sudeith to date and mark a significant development in his process. The impressions are accompanied by one, time-lapse video that documents him carving stones and making impressions at multiple sites. These videos give a rare glance at the final carving and the day to day operations of the artist.

 Sudeith’s carvings, or petroglyphs, take on many roles. As site-specific public pieces, they are beautiful and act as permanent historical markers playing with the ideas of culture and time. Sudeith uses the carvings to create handmade impressions which he calls, his paintings, to explore contemporary image making. Lastly holding printmaking and papermaking workshops he engages with communities providing education and moments of sharing, even allowing people to take home a rubbing.

 Kevin Sudeith is a knight errant. He travels in search of historical fame and fortune thought his deeds as an artist. Like many wandering adventures he battles more with the elements and finds little of what he set out for. Yet, Sudeith is leaving behind a trail of wonderful relationships and is enriching the world with thoughtful objects about us.

 Sudeith (b. 1965, St. Paul, MN) received a BFA from the San Francisco Art Institute and an MFA from the School of Visual Arts in New York City, where he has lived for the past 25 years. His work has been most recently exhibited at Pulse Miami Beach in, 2017, Mike Weiss Gallery, 2016 and the North Highland Museum in Canada, 2013. Sudeith has been making public carvings since 2003 and has many permanent installations including Rockaway Beach, New York, Grand Rapids, Michigan and Smelt Brook, Nova Scotia. Sudeith is currently ‘at large’, traveling and making petroglyphs.

itivity to the anthropomorphic aesthetics these tools have acquired. The artworks in Touchstone orbit around the concept of the noosphere “…[an] imagining, in one way or another, above the animal biosphere, a human sphere, a sphere of reflection, a conscious invention, of conscious souls,” - Telihard de Chardin, “Hominization” (1923).

 In the context of this exhibition de Chardin’s “soul” can be taken to mean self-awareness or sentience. The artworks, though inanimate, possess qualities familiar to animals, humans - and more recently - to neural networks, and artificial intelligences. These objects were gifted self awareness by their makers and allowed to reflect themselves. They are present, purposeful, and knowledgeable, yet obviously inhuman. Although composed of familiar elements populating our everyday, these artworks seem to beckon to a world beyond our senses.

 In the Turing test, a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior becomes indistinguishable from that of a human. It is in our mind that an AI becomes human; it is in the viewer’s mind that these artworks become animate. From collections of steel, glass, resin, and pigment, a “soul” emerges. These artworks are reminders that there are touchstones used to interpret reality other than those we are most familiar with. In the words of the scholar Graham Harvey, “…the world is full of persons, only some of whom are human.”

Curator: Dr. Myrah Brown Green


 FiveMyles presents the first solo exhibition in Brooklyn of the photographs by the esteemed and beloved photographer/artist Jamel Shabazz.

 This journalistic timeline documents almost forty years of historical moments photographed by Jamel Shabazz. These include images of the hip hop culture, the Native American community, the Masonic experiences, the Rastafarian Family and Shabazz’ iconic subway rides.

 Mr. Shabazz, through the lens of his camera, has looked at New York and New Yorkers with sympathy and an extraordinary sense of moment for four decades. His photographs have been a source of pride to this complicated city, Shabzz’ images show its humanity, its big city callousness, its many faces and its humor.

 The curator Dr. Myrah Brown Green has especially chosen images that so clearly point to Shabazz’ feeling of being connected to those he photographs, and their moment of connection with him. Myrah Brown Green sees this exhibition as Jamel Shabazz’ personal square; this square we all inhabit, and into which we allow others to enter.

 Jamel Shabazz photographs have been shown among other prestigious venues at ArtBasel Miami, the Brooklyn Museum, the Bronx Museum, the Newark Museum, the Contact Photo Festival, the Victoria Albert Museum, Duke University and the Adidas Photo festival in Ethiopia.

 Dr. Myrah Brown Green is an art historian, author, lecturer, arts consultant and independent curator.

Bidstrup’s work explores optical phenomena and interprets utopic social and architectural ideas through glass sculpture, installation and video. Her curiosity revolves around the power of perception, context and point of view in constructing our understanding through vision and how the human eye and mind are always engaged in myriad determinations and negotiations.

 Bidstrup studied at the Rhode Island School of Design and has taught at her alma mater, the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Art, School of Design on Bornholm since 2009. She was a visiting lecturer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2015. Bidstrup has exhibited internationally for the past decade. She is the co-founder of The Copenhagen-based collaborative Luftkraft Glass Studio.

Somewhere beyond the scorched gable end and the burnt-out buses
 there is a poet indulging
 his wretched rage for order –
 or not as the case may be; for his
 is a dying art,
 an eddy of semantic scruples
 in an unstructurable sea.

<![CDATA[
ents Whatever You Say Say Nothing, Stefana McClure’s fifth solo exhibition with the gallery. Taken from a poem by Seamus Heaney, the title originates with the secretive activity of Northern Ireland’s rebel paramilitary that admonished its members with this demand.

 The exhibition navigates the relationship between art and politics, interrogating the nature of artistic responsibility, the clash and blend of different traditions, the endless interaction, for better or worse, of past and present, the dangerous undercurrents of injustice and resentment, complacency and discontent, while also pointing to memory as mutable, prone to the passage of time and the vagaries of the imagination.

 Explosions were everyday events in the Belfast of the early 1970s where McClure grew up and they figure largely in a series of new Teflon drawings. Taking the form of open notebooks, each is a rendering of a protest poem “typed” on a sensitive Teflon surface by typists and stenographers wearing special gloves that have been modified to bear an IBM Selectric golfball at the end of each finger. Rich with imagery of drums, bombs, banners and sectarian graffiti, as Heaney put it, these poems strive to “grant the religious intensity of the violence its deplorable authenticity and complexity.”

 Eight small jackets (the size worn by first grade elementary school students) are hung low on pegs, their pockets groaning under the weight of the hefty poetry-wrapped stones that they accommodate. Often displaying a reckless courage, children from Catholic ghettos grew up throwing stones at police vans and army vehicles, taunting soldiers as they hauled off fathers and brothers in dawn raids. The text of a single “troubles” poem is divided between the two stones, one for each pocket, ready to be thrown. The words of the poems gain literal weight and even the anticipation of action and violence from their supports.

 Hand-knit reconstructions of vintage Snakes and Ladders boards, presented both on the wall and on a shelf, are a reminder that, born in another place or at another time, some of those same six-year-olds might have engaged in more innocent forms of play.

 Deconstructed and reconfigured as a continuous ball of string, The Fortress of Solitude by Jonathan Lethem stands as a single sculpture, a complete world unto itself. The shape-shifting demons of racism haunting Brooklyn in the 1970s have an obvious parallel in the themes of sectarian division and intransigence, the fear, suspicion and violence that Irish children are heir to. Translating, transposing, and decoding the synesthetic structure connecting text and image, McClure unveils the layers of embedded information to which we are constantly subjected and brings to light the complexities and the aftermath of violence on societies.

 Born in Lisburn, Northern Ireland, Stefana McClure lives and works in New York. She has exhibited extensively at museums and galleries internationally. McClure’s work was recently exhibited in White Covers-Private Choices, curated by Carine Fol, at CENTRALE for Contemporary Art in Brussels. In 2017, she was a Frank Williams Visiting Artist at Wellesley College, MA. Select exhibitions include: Die Frick Kollektion: works from the Kunstsammlung Mezzanin, Liechtenstein, curated by Arno Egger, Kunst Palais Liechtenstein, Feldkirch, Austria (2017); Deep Cuts: Contemporary Paper Cutting, curated by Samantha Cataldo, Currier Museum of Art, Manchester, NH (2017); The Times, The Flag Art Foundation, New York, NY (2017); What’s Yours is Mine, Bartha Contemporary, London, UK (2017); Format: 35 Jahre Sammlung Schroth, curated by Juliane Rogge, Museum Wilhelm Morgner, Soest, DE (2017); The Siege of the Flying Mermaids, Josée Bienvenu Gallery, New York (2015); Possible Side Effects, Arróniz Arte Contemporanéo, Mexico City, MX (2015); and Terrible Beauty: Art, Crisis, Change &amp; The Office of Non-Compliance, Dublin Contemporary Biennial, IE (2011).

Arts + Leisure presents Field Days, an exhibition of new work by Zach Seeger and Amie Cunat. Cunat’s paintings feature biomorphic forms and abstractions of natural subjects, while Seeger presents a group of paintings of houses and domestic interiors, along with carved wood sculptures. Both artists turn an incisive eye towards considerations of perception and relationships of color and line, filtered through their unique approaches to painting. In addition to presenting their own work, the two artists produced a collaborative painted environment at the Arts+Leisure space, utilizing architectural elements including polychromed baseboards, moldings, trim, and a doorframe.

 Simultaneously recalling the work of Surrealist and Color Field painters, Cunat’s paintings bear an enigmatic presence. Her use of compositional cues drawn from the natural world (particularly evident in her abstraction of a sunflower) along with her penchant for sophisticated and unpredictable color harmonies infuses her work with a subtle tension of familiarity and otherworldliness. As if responding to archetypal rhythms and forms, her paintings share underlying impulses that animate her tableaux of abstractions. Color takes on a central importance, with modulating harmonies inflecting atmospheric resonances and providing a sense of momentum within her compositions. Moreover, Cunat often blurs the divide between line and color, using swaths of color to delineate forms rather than line. Cunat has previously worked with the mediums of sculpture and and installation, creating immersive environments that depict traditional Shaker meeting houses and American church architecture; her current paintings reflect a similar turn towards interactivity, embodying whimsical and playful qualities that beckon the viewer’s engagement.

 Like Cunat, Zach Seeger paints with an astute awareness of the allusive and formal potential of color, though his subjects are often representational. Contrasts of light and darkness, interior and exterior, and privacy and voyeurism define his paintings of suburban homes and their inhabitants in Field Days, lending them an otherworldly “inside out” quality. Scenes of domestic life flow into the into the outside world and vice versa, as if separated by a mere membrane, and the solidity of things are undermined, rendering walls and other structural elements as precarious, indeterminate forms. Seeger’s brushwork is extremely fluid, with patches of light and color dancing around his loose, open ended compositions, seldom allowing them to resolve in a moment of stillness. Abstract forms recalling Cunat’s biomorphic imagery appear throughout Seeger’s canvases, and he similarly uses color in place of line.

 The whimsical character of the paintings somewhat obscures their undertones of voyeurism and surveillance; the houses are seen from various angles, including aerial perspectives, and the inhabitants seem wholly unaware of the presence of an outside observer. Seeger captures the messiness of life in his work, and his technique functions as a sort of physical analogue of its constant flux. The barriers between the household and the outside world are dissolved, with each spilling into the other, a statement on the impossibility of compartmentalizing the roaring stream of life. His scultpures, “Mother” and “Drunk Pikachu”, diverge from the domestic subjects of the paintings, instead focusing on cultural tropes and symbols. “Mother” recalls prehistoric representations of the female form, while “Drunk Pikachu” distorts the popular character into an absurd oddity.

 Zach Seeger is a painter and sculptor working in Brooklyn and upstate New York. He received his BFA from Binghamton University and MFA from the Rhode Island School of Design. He has exhibited in the stARTup Fair LA, Artspace Tetra in Fukoka, Japan and Life on Mars Gallery, Brooklyn. He has taught 3D Design, sculpture, painting, drawing and graphic design at Brown University, Berkeley College and Binghamton University. He was the director of This Friday or Next Friday gallery in DUMBO, Brooklyn from 2013-2017.
 Amie Cunat lives and works in New York, NY. She received her MFA from Cornell University in 2012, a Post-Baccalaureate in Painting and Drawing from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2010, and her BA in Visual Arts and Art History from Fordham University in 2008. Cunat has had solo exhibitions in New York and abroad at the Knockdown Center, Sunroom Project Space at Wave Hill, The Cooper Union, AIRY Gallery, among others. Recent group exhibitions include C+C: Kat Chamberlin and Amie Cunat at Spring Break Art Show in New York, NY, Western Decoy at No Place Gallery in Columbus, OH and Sine Gallery: Berlin at tête, Berlin, Germany.

Still Big is a group exhibition inspired by 17th century Dutch Still-Life paintings. These works broke away from the use of religious subject matter to depict secular objects like flowers, food, and bones in domestic interiors. These paintings explored quotidian reality as well as larger themes of life and mortality.

 In Still Big, paintings, photos and sculptures are arranged on or around tables designed by NY based furniture designers. These contemporary tableaus employ surprising juxtapositions to evoke erotic, gustatory and optical pleasures as well as poignant allusions to human frailty.

 Artists: Priscilla Fusco, Ethan Greenbaum, Kira Nam Greene, Eric Hibit, Myeongsoo Kim, John Newman, Sarah Peters, Chelsey Pettyjohn, Adrianne Rubenstein, Roger White, B. Wurtz, Crys Yin.

 Designers: ERICKSON AESTHETICS, Miduny, Moving Mountains, PHAEDO.

 Presented by TSA New York, Curated by Sun You.

<![CDATA[
You see, what we’re talkin’ about here is an organism that imitates other life-forms, and it imitates ’em perfectly.
 —John Carpenter’s The Thing

 Plein air painting is a weird choice for a contemporary artist, leading the practitioner dangerously close to being labeled a hobbyist or a “Sunday painter” (a creature that seems to exist mostly in ghost stories for people with MFAs). The impulse to paint from nature, in nature, feels antique, more the stuff of historical re-creation than of the serious contemporary artist. Painters Anna Ortiz and Hilary Baldwin embrace this oddity, taking the constituent elements of plein air, the landscape and the figure within it, as their starting points, their paintings not so much a representation of that landscape as an uncanny encapsulation of the friction between painter and subject. Working in nature, with their subject simultaneously the site of their practice, both artists produce a kind of visionary art, capturing what is present but not immediately recognizable.

 Anna Ortiz engages simultaneously with the landscape around her and the landscape of her imagination, populating otherwise pleasant vistas with structures of indeterminate origin and unknown purpose. Even when painted entirely from observation they have an air of unreality, interruptions in landscapes that, despite their beauty, are suffused with a sense of unease.

 In Hilary Baldwin’s work, the environment is both a reflection and projection of the self. She observes the natural world not so much to acquire its likeness as to capture the mood of her relationship to it, creating works in which the landscape unsettlingly returns our gaze, mirroring the painter standing in it. Building frame-like extensions for her paintings, she emphasizes their physical presence to the viewer, such that they appear to be reaching out to meet us.



 Anna Ortiz (born 1979 in Worcester MA, currently living in Brooklyn NY) is a painter primarily focused on creating uncanny landscapes. Her work reflects on global issues through painterly collapses and constructions. Ortiz received a BA/BFA from Tufts University and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts Boston. During her undergraduate years, she spent a year studying at the Louvre in Paris. Ortiz completed her MFA at Tyler School of Art, spending her second year in Rome Italy. Her work has been exhibited at Lesley Heller Gallery NY, Storefront Ten Eyck NY and Galeria Il Polittico Rome.

 Hilary Baldwin is a painter in Catskill NY. Her work has been included in solo and group exhibitions in New York, Chicago, Boston, Toronto, and Berlin. She has attended residency programs at The Ragdale Foundation, The Woodstock Byrdcliffe Guild, and in 2014 received a cultural grant from The City of Chicago to attend The Atlantic Center for the Arts, where she studied with the painter Dana Schutz. Hilary has worked with children, teens, and adults as a teaching artist for over ten years, and an artists’ book featuring her series of food paintings was recently published by Soberscove Press in Chicago. She holds a BFA in painting from The Maryland Institute College of Art and an MFA from The School of The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

Born and raised in Queens, NY to Norwegian/Dominican parents, the collaborative team of artists and sisters Lisa and Janelle Iglesias work together as Las Hermanas Iglesias, a moniker that locates their identity within the historical and philosophical contexts of feminism, teamwork, and multiplicity
]]>
<![CDATA[
. Over the past ten years of the artists’ collective art practice, Las Hermanas, have worked formally and informally with their mother Bodhild as well. For their latest project at Ortega y Gasset, Las Hermanas Iglesias have further expanded this familial cooperation, actively including Lisa’s son, Bowie, in the development and creation of LOOPS AT A SPOOL. The exhibition features a dialogic call and response between the four family members, across 3 generations and multiple mediums.

 LOOPS AT A SPOOL features works on paper, created by Las Hermanas Iglesias, alongside textile counterparts that function as visual translations, knit by Bodhild. As the matriarch of the Norwegian-Dominican family, Bodhild has long played the role as translator, the only member who speaks Norwegian, Spanish and English fluently. Growing up in rural Norway, Bodhild cultivated a deep intimacy with knitting and other textile traditions such as weaving and embroidery, techniques she now instrumentalizes as translational processes.

 Her youngest grandchild and namesake, Bowie, is six years old. Understanding his role as co-conspirator and interpreter, Bowie’s contributions are mischievously placed throughout the gallery, serving as echoes and responses to the specific forms and stories he discovers in his collaborator’s work. This exhibition marks the first time that Lisa, Janelle, Bodhild and Bowie are exhibiting work created in concert with each other as Familien Iglesias.

 While childhood has been imagined as the most fearlessly creative time in one’s life, children are often regarded as a major distraction to a professional, critical practice. Eschewing this notion as well as the tradition of the solitary (and usually male) cultural producer, Familien Iglesias is interested in exploring and celebrating the ways in which the multiple members influence, distract, reshape and finish each other’s aesthetic sentences. Like the palindromic title suggests, the works in LOOPS AT A SPOOL are motivated by a rhythmic back and forth dialogue, a sense of play and an exploration of how ideas translate between different materials, laying bare the commonalities and glitches between objects and phenomena.

 Las Hermanas Iglesias is the project-based collaboration of Lisa and Janelle Iglesias. For their project at Ortega y Gasset Projects, the artists have extended their collaboration to include their mother, Bodhild, and Lisa’s son, Bowie, under the collective name Familien Iglesias.

 Bodhild Brendryen Iglesias was born in Folldal, Norway, and moved to NYC when she was 20. Shortly thereafter, she fell in love Bienvenido, a political scientist from the Dominican Republic, whom she married and raised 4 daughters in Queens, NYC with. Bo worked as a NYC Public School teacher for 12 years, has been skiing since she was 2, knitting since she was 9, and has collaborated with her youngest daughters off and on for the past 10 years. She is the only Iglesias family member who speaks English, Norwegian and Spanish fluently (in addition to some German and French).

 Lisa received her MFA from the University of Florida where she is now an Assistant Professor of Drawing &amp; Painting and mother to Bowery Katskill Gerlitz Iglesias. Janelle earned her degree in Sculpture from VCU and and is currently a Visiting Assistant Professor of Sculpture at Carnegie Mellon University. Lisa and Janelle’s individual &amp; collaborative work have been exhibited at El Museo del Barrio, the Queens Museum, Sculpture Center, Abrons Art Center and other spaces. As a team they’ve been artists in residence at the Cité Internationale des Arts through LMCC’s Paris residency program, Fanoon: Center for Print Research at VCU Qatar and Stoneleaf Retreat in New York. Their individual and collaborative work has been supported by the Queens Council for the Arts, NYFA, NALAC, The Joan Mitchell Foundation and the Pollock-Krasner Foundation. Las Hermanas maintain an ad hoc studio in Queens while working on projects in lots of places.

SARDINE presents a group show titled Italicized Reality featuring work by Liz Ainslie, Andy Cross, Christopher Dunlap, Robin Kang, Jennifer J Lee, and Dana Powell.

 “Access to an alternative reality, a “beyond” where the usual physical laws don’t apply and various manifestations of cosmic consciousness or divinity present themselves as unmistakably real” – Michael Pollan, How to Change your Mind

 Many parallels can be drawn between Michael Pollan’s new book regarding the science of psychedelics, and the artistic experience of creation. In both, personal visions are explored. Space becomes defined, by modeling forms using value and color. Time is necessary for creation. The idea, the ephemera, becomes grounded in material richness. Through the hands of these artists the ineffability of a mystical experience is underscored, and reality is italicized.

 Liz Ainslie is a painter living in Brooklyn, NY. Ainslie received an MFA from Tyler School of Art in 2004 and a BFA from Alfred University in 2001. She has had solo exhibitions at Transmitter Gallery and Airplane in Bushwick, Brooklyn, Creon Gallery in Manhattan and The Cohen Gallery at Alfred University. Her work has been included in shows at Station Independent Projects, Orgy Park, Ground Floor Gallery, Outlet Fine Art, Centotto, Parallel Art Space, Small Black Door, SARDINE and A.I.R. gallery in Brooklyn; Valentine in Ridgewood, Queens; Lu Magnus, Artjail and Spazio 522 in Manhattan; Vox Populi and Ice Box Project Space in Philadelphia; BCB Fine Art and Imogen Holloway in upstate New York, and Gallerie Kritiku, Prague, Czech Republic. Her work has been reviewed in Giornale Dell’ Arte, ArtCal Zine and The GC Advocate. Interviews with the artist can be found on blogs including And Freedom For, Pencil in the Studio, #fffffff Walls, Standard Interview, Otino Corsano. Her work is included in the Pierogi Flat Files Ainslie was a visiting artist at Trestle Projects in 2018, faculty at School of the Alternative, 2017, a resident artist at Millay Colony for the Arts, 2011 and at Atlantic Center for the Arts, 2006.

 Andy Cross (b. 1979, Williamsburg, Virginia) lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. Cross received a MFA from Hunter College in 2005. His work has been exhibited in New York and Internationally. A larger installation titled “House Painter” received a solo show at the Max Mara, Maramotti Family Museum and Collection in Regio Emilia, Italy (2013). In New York and Brooklyn he has had 6 solo exhibitions to date, one is currently up at Zieher Smith in Chelsea. He has also shown with Martos (2013), Kravets Wehby (2006), Cathouse Funeral (2014), and SARDINE (2014 / 2016). Other solo projects were with Mario Diacono in Boston, Massachusetts (2005/2007).

 Christopher Dunlap received his BFA from University of Washington and his MFA from Massachusetts College of Art. Recent exhibitions include Site 131, Dallas, TX; Mckenzie Fine Art, NY, NY; No Place Gallery, Columbus, OH; SARDINE (solo), Brooklyn, NY; Regina Rex, NY, NY; Parlour Bushwick, Brooklyn, NY; Spring Break Art Fair, NY, NY; Centotto, Brooklyn, NY; Space Available, Brooklyn, NY; and GCA (solo), Brooklyn, NY. His work has been written about in The New York Times, Artsy, Art F City, Two Coats of Paint and Travel Magazine. Dunlap’s paintings engage the viewer through a playful, disruptive exploration of color and pattern. These forms create a multiplicity of relationships between simple shapes and complex structures. Through specific placement, repetition, and implied perspective, the paintings assert a sense of depth. By creating an image that can register spatially in multiple ways, the paintings draw the viewer to a heightened awareness of their own visual processes. This sustained attention seeks to bridge a gap between perception and sensation.

 Inspired by her southwestern upbringing, Robin Kang reinterprets the tradition of weaving within a contemporary context. Utilizing a digitally operated Jacquard hand loom, the contemporary version of the first binary operated machine and argued precursor to the invention of the computer, she hand weaves tapestries that combine ancient symbolism, computer related imagery, and digital mark making. The juxtaposition of textiles with electronics opens an interesting conversation of reconciling the old with the new, traditions with new possibilities, as well as the relationship between textiles, symbols, language, and memory. Kang has exhibited throughout the US, Canada, Spain, Belgium, France, Austria, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia. Recent institutional shows include the Queens Museum, the Essl Museum, John Michael Kohler Arts Center, U.S Embassy in Saudi Arabia and Brooklyn Academy of Music, among others. She has participated in artist residencies in Texas, Michigan, Massachusetts, and Beijing. Kang is the founder and director of Penelope, an artist-run project space in Ridgewood, Queens, and also an Adjunct Professor in the Fiber and Material Studies Department at Tyler School of Art, teaching courses in digital weaving and fabric dyeing.

 Jennifer J Lee is a Brooklyn based artist from Pittsburgh, PA. She holds a BFA from Carnegie Mellon University and an MFA in painting from the Rhode Island School of Design 2010. She has studied at École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Paris France and has attended Skowegan School of painting and sculpture in the summer of 2009. Lee has exhibited at Klaus von Nichtssagend Gallery, Central Park Gallery (LA), Underdonk Gallery, Canada, and the Mattress Factory. Her other projects include Sister, a curatorial platform and guest editor at Black Cat journal.

 Dana Powell (b. 1989 Milwaukee, Wisconsin) lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. Her recent solo exhibitions include Smoke Screen, Allen &amp; Eldridge, New York (2017); Closer Things, SARDINE, Brooklyn, curated by Amy Feldman (2016); and Life Paintings, The Still House Group, Brooklyn (2016). Recent group exhibitions include Pine Barrens, Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, New York, curated by Brandy Carstens (2018); Lure of the Dark, Mass MoCA, curated by Susan Cross (2018); and The skies and the atmosphere most luscious, Allen &amp; Eldridge, New York, curated by Dylan Kraus (2017). Dana Powell received her BFA from Cooper Union in 2015.

Cuchifritos Gallery and Residency Unlimited presents their eighth annual collaboration, The Impossibility of Form, featuring new work from artists Tomás Cunha Ferreira (Portugal), Tzu Tung Lee (Taiwan), and Kairon Liu (Taiwan).

 Exploring a diversity of subjects—the status of the art object, political action, social inclusion—Ferreira, Lee and Liu reject the rarefied space of categorical definitions moving between materiality and disciplines. Through distinct practices, their work investigates the complex relationship between institutional structures and visual language, and in both composition and content asserts a state of in-betweenness.

<![CDATA[
For INTERVALS, Abraham McNally presents a series of over 100 hand carved sculptures made of wood and wool. Poplar and cedar logs were cut and milled with a chainsaw at his childhood home; a Christmas tree farm in Northern Vermont. Raw sheep fleece was collected from a local farm. These simple materials open conversations between past, present, and place. This human-scale sculpture offers a personal visceral encounter: body of sculpture to body of viewer.

 Abraham was born in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont in 1975. He now lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. He received his B.A. in fine arts from Bard College and his M.F.A. from Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts at Bard College. His work has been exhibited in New York, San Francisco, Boston, Philadelphia, China, Germany, Belgium, and France. He teaches at Parsons The New School for Design.

For In-Between at the Invisible Dog Center’s Glass House, Caroline Cloutier uses the mirror as an extension of the photographic device to produce images. She thus brings the out-of-field space inside the Glass House and exploits the visual qualities of its surroundings. The effect is a complex spatial composition that leads the viewer in a contemplative experience about the in-between.

 Caroline Cloutier is particularly interested in the reflective function inherent to specular and photographic images and their capacity for suggesting virtual spaces. In recent years, she has arranged mirrors and large-scale photographic prints to create monumental collages that section and modulate the exhibition space. Blending in with the architecture of the occupied venues, her installations modulate the space, open virtual passages, and effect a mise en abyme within the exhibition setup. They provide contemplative experiences that suggest a space that one might imagine or discover beyond the image. Mental projection leads the body to inscribe itself in these virtual spaces.

 Caroline Cloutier lives and works in Montreal (Canada), where she practices photography and installation. Her works have been shown in Montreal, Toronto (CA), New York (US), Linz (AT) and Rome (IT). She has had a number of international residencies: Linz in 2014 and 2016, Gros Morne National Park, Newfoundland (CA), in 2016, and Rome in 2017. She holds a bachelor’s degree in visual and media arts from the Université du Québec à Montréal and she is currently pursuing a MFA in Photography at Concordia University (Montreal, CAN). Her last installation, In-Between (2018), created especially for the Invisible Dog Center is her first solo show in New York.

Fortnight Institute presents Visitations, Greg Burak’s first solo exhibition in New York.

 Looking at Greg Burak’s paintings makes the act of seeing feel secretive or forbidden. The paintings invite the viewer to peer into these private scenes, evoking a feeling of transgression. A door has been left ajar, a window open, a cover lifted for the curious to enter and acquire hidden knowledge. The interiors are familiar and comfortable, set up with books, paintings, plants, furniture and a cat, in one case. The figures in Burak’s work are mysterious, facing away mostly, as they are completely engaged in their environment. In Visitations, Burak’s paintings pulsate with tension, presenting scenes that are both unsettling and intriguing, culling elements from both the mundane and esoteric. The dichotomy between the ordinary and the peculiar leaves the viewer with a myriad of questions. In Burak’s painting, Vision, the center figure’s hand is a mossy green echoing the color patterns of the square apparition floating above a mysterious portal that leads to somewhere/nowhere. Why is the hand green? What is this appearance of a green diaphanous square? The figure in the yellow shirt holds a thin wooden stick or wand? The window behind them: is it a window or an illusion?

 I was once the steward of a book of magical spells. It sat in a conspicuous place on my shelf, catching my sidelong glance. One night a friend suggested that we perform one of them. While the possibility of conjuring something into being was tantalizing, I was simultaneously terrified at what these spells could awaken. I hastily declined – much to my own chagrin and the amusement of my friend.

 I realized then I wasn’t prepared for the possibility of this actually working. I thought I was looking for confirmation of something otherworldly, but how could I move forward knowing that there were uncanny forces at play? Something just beyond the edge of human perception?
 Would I have to rethink the Catholic system I had abandoned? Some biblical force might not have been pleased with my infernal dabbling. It seemed that everything was on the table, and the possibilities overwhelmed me. It was a conundrum that I decided to avoid; I settled on agnosticism and moved on.

 Although my direct interaction with the supernatural was put on hold, I can’t help but wonder what may have happened. These paintings are about the possibilities of a foray into the paranormal. I’m interested in capturing the faltering moment at the threshold between the everyday and the supernatural. Although some of these player’s attempts may be half-hearted or unpolished, it’s hard to say what might reach across the void. - Greg Burak

 Greg Burak was born in 1986 in Haverstraw, NY. He received a BFA from the Maryland Institute College of Art and an MFA from Indiana University. His work has been included in exhibitions at Gitler &amp; _____, Trestle Gallery, and First Street Gallery. He currently lives and works in Queens, New York.

Curated by Raul Zamudio and Juan Puntes with Peter Wayne Lewis

 Since the twenty-first century, the U.S. seems to be in a state of accelerated social transformation and this has been cause for alarm for many conservative, White Americans. One of the most notable benchmarks of these changes is Barack Obama’s election as America’s first African-American president. Researchers also predict that in the coming decades, Latinos/Hispanics will be the largest demographic in the U.S. superseding the current White majority. Other communities that have been historically marginalized and now ostensibly asserting their rights including LGBTQ+, have added to the perception that we are living in a different America than in the past. Another phenomenon altering the American social landscape is the influx of immigrants that some construe as potentially usurping the purported dominant culture and its traditions. Even Donald Trump’s campaign slogan of Make America Great Again, subliminally harks back to a reactive era of intolerance and exclusivity.

 White Anxieties is a mixed media, international group exhibition that takes the pulse of what haunts the conservative, American psyche. That is, an anxiety-inducing America that is less white, heterosexual, and male, and where other languages than English are spoken and where People of Color can openly express their cultural traditions without accusations of not being “real” Americans. Some works in the exhibition, for example, address the dismantling of Confederate monuments, the problematics of assimilation, and xenophobia’s prevalence while others target the most disturbing manifestation of American socio-political regression and of an America historically unresolved: David Duke and acolytes who run for political office while attempting to normalize their racial supremacist ideology.

Pablo’s Birthday presents the artist Galeno in collaboration with his Brazilian gallery Karla Osorio. This exhibition represents the artist’s first solo gallery show in the United States and brings together a consistent and mature production.

 Born in the north of Brazil (Piauí/ Parnaíba), Galeno lived, studied, and worked most of his life in Brasília. Three years ago moving back to his origins in his birthplace region, the artist deepened his research, enriching it with new meanings and an increasingly broad universe from paintings to sculptures and objects. He creates a new and original geometry, influenced by ancestral elements, connected to his own history. The show proposes a panorama of more recent works with a few historical pieces.

 Galeno is a leading Brazilian artist born in Delta do Parnaíba, Piauí (1957) and living between Brasília and Parnaíba. He studied visual arts at the University of Brasília (UNB). Using several techniques such as painting, drawings, engraving, fresco, sculpture and installation, he is one of the most active Brazilian artists. He chose his solitude in the last years to concentrate even more in his production.

 Mainly influenced by Brazilian Constructivism and geometry, his work constantly fluctuates between figurative and abstract elements in an interpretive exercise. Through his unique treatment of color and sophisticate compositions, he establishes a rhythm, constructing a vibrant universe. Contemporary, but strongly attached to his personal history, he turns his subjective experience into universal themes through a poetic symbology. He incorporates unexpected and innovative elements, retracing in an erudite way his artistic path. Among his main subjects are trivial objects such as: reels, lamps, keyholes, chameleons, fragments of a modern architecture, river boats, saints and reliquaries, which all together become part of a new vocabulary. Art and life are merged, telling a story, sharing a past, generating a new future in art. Galeno has participated in numerous group and solo exhibitions in Brazil and abroad, mainly in Europe. There are several texts and publications on his work. He has won several awards such as Acquisition Prize, including for residences abroad. In 2012 he was chosen by the IPHAN/MinC as the author of the Our Lady of Fatima church’s great panel, in Brasília, succeeding the great Italian-Brazilian painter Alfredo Volpi. He participated at Bienal do Mercosul 2015. His works are in several private and public collections in Brazil and abroad, including Museu de Arte do Rio, Museu de Arte Moderna in Rio de Janeiro, among others.

 According to curator Marco Antonio Vieira, Galeno’s works seems to “gravitate around the objects picked by his desire as a painter. An encounter of intense colorations in which the figurative elements abandon their anchorage in the scene which would contextualize them to appear as quasi-phantasmatic signs, so as to hint at a chain which denotes dislocation and reiterates a symptomal picture in which the same appears altered yet insistent. There would be, therefore, something tantamount to a structure, which takes on the form of a signature herein. It is within this framework that Galeno is seen.

“My work focuses on reconnecting time. Time is an illusory and shapeless substance. It is homogeneous along its entire length, and we recognize each of its distinct ages by the objects it produces and leaves behind. Time is like a blank canvas on which each age leaves its own inimitable imprint, coloring it with its own recognizable objects. Our parents and grandparents, and generations that came before them were all defined by the objects of their age. We see them in old photographs dressed in the fashion of the day, sitting next to their record players or driving their quaint motor cars. The old photographs, the black-and-white images printed on cardboard from the century before last or the Polaroids from the 1970s, are also now a thing of the past - as are earlier oil portrait of men and women who came before them. It is the objects that pin us to the blank canvas of our time.

 I collect those objects, the images of the people they used to define and the ideas - in philosophy, technology, the arts - that gave rise to them, and put them in my work.

 I work in a variety of media. I make paintings, collages, sculpture, drawings, and ceramics. I scour flea markets looking for an old object, for machines, mechanisms, and devices of the past, whose purpose we no longer understand but that are ineluctably pinned to the age when they were created. They were once indispensable and useful, and they defined their time. I don’t try to restore or even understand them, but I find a new life for them in my work.

 Our own age is defined by the amazing variety of objects we have created, but even more so by the objects, we have discarded. This doesn’t mean that time has accelerated but rather that ages change one another at a kaleidoscopic pace, without having time to define themselves, to shape into an image or to leave a memory. I see my work as stringing together those half-formed shards of ages and reconnecting them into a continuous timeline.”

Ed. Varie presents solo exhibition, Piezo Flora with artist Justin Suazo.

 Piezo is derived from the Greek piezein, which means to squeeze or press. Piezo Flora, Justin Suazo’s debut art exhibition, consists of a series of scanned and reprinted paper towels that were used in the cleaning of micro piezo inkjet printers.

 The cybernetic-flora relationship between human and machine manifests itself in the colors and abstract forms absorbed by Suazo’s meticulous collection of paper towels. Suazo runs a digital printing studio that utilizes this technology and has been amassing paper towels since 2014. Paper towels are left overnight under inkjet printheads to prevent the printer from clogging. They are also used to wipe up spills or catch drips from tools and equipment. These acts of maintenance, which are necessary for the printer and its encompassing business to survive, mimic the reproductive relationship between bees and flowers to their greater plants. Like flowers, the colors and forms that emerge are beautiful and captivating to the human eye.

 The human-machine relationship is doubly realized in the act of scanning and reprinting the printer’s cybernetic blooms. The flower-like simulacrum of having advance imaging technology recreate the organic and abstract image it once oozed and bled is both beautiful and perverse. It is a physical imaging feedback loop. It is a digital-physical double flower mutation - the outcome of human, machine, and commercial systems intersecting.

 By outfitting his printers to use reactive dye, these prints have a naturally-embedded vibrancy and density. Reactive dye is specifically used in natural fabrics like silk and cotton. Instead of sitting on top of substrates the way pigment inks do, dye penetrates the fibers. When the dye is bonded to the fibers through steaming, the colors spring into life.

 “I like to try and imagine the way certain flowers like orchids or dianthus get their color. I’ve yet to see footage of a Sweet William dianthus or a Yellow Speckle orchid get its color, but I imagine it occurs when no one is looking in the middle of the night inside the flower’s private enclosure.”

Tenri Cultural Institute presents a joint exhibition by Reiko Yashiro and Nobuko Hiroi.

 Fiber artist, Rieko Yashiro, is inspired by the art and design of television programs and theater stages. In this show, Yashiro presents three pieces that depict reincarnation. Utilizing paper, fabric, and threads, the work is inspired by Buddhism. The color back indicates the world in Hades, red represents the bright and sunny world, and the light beige tone show the everyday ordinary world. Yashiro hopes that you will experience her art through the colors and will look for fiber art in mainstream culture in the future. Yashiro’s works were also featured on NHK’s “Kohaku,” the annual New Year’s Eve television special.

 Nobuko Hiroi is an artist living in Kyoto, who creates art using natural threads and fibers. She uses a freestyle modeling approach, starting with a two or three dimensional shape and embracing the image inspired from the technique and material. Irregular silk threads are cut and tied and woven for this show. The piece shows the production process and includes a few irregular knots on the surface of the fabric. The title, ‘Traveling Textiles,’ refers to the time passed in making the fabric and the space that exists within.

<Description>
<![CDATA[
The SMET group is beginning construction of their new rail lines, however the Insectoids have become a liability to their transit expansion plans. The SMET group forms CTON, an anti-insect task force subsidiary. Stage 1 of the CTON initiative is to start misting their newly developed PX-Sprëj, a repellent specially formulated to exterminate the Insectoids.

 Using installation, video, painting, and sculpture, Arvid Logan pieces together an alternate world that pulls from the imagery of his childhood. Logan re-imagines the conflicts of living in an increasingly privatized and authoritative city as a war between insects and exterminators.
